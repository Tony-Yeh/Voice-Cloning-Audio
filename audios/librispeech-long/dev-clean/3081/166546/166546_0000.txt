SWEET LITTLE MISS CLARKE. WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE. HIS ANSWER CONVEYED THE SOMEWHAT EXCITING INFORMATION THAT THE FOUR PERSONS SEATED IN MY REAR WERE THE SAME FOUR WHO HAD BEEN READING AT THE ROUND TABLE IN THE MEZZANINE AT THE TIME OF MISS CHALLONER'S DEATH. INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS. IS IT ONE FAMILY I ASKED. YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE. TRANSIENTS OF COURSE BUT VERY WELL KNOWN IN DENVER. THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT. THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER. THEIR WORD OUGHT TO BE GOOD. GEORGE NODDED. THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT. DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME. THEY DID LAST NIGHT. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WILL MEET THIS STATEMENT OF THE DOCTOR'S. GEORGE. HE LEANED NEARER. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE. THAT SHE STABBED HERSELF. AND ARE YOU SURE THAT NONE WAS. POSITIVE SUCH A FACT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN KEPT QUIET. IF A WEAPON HAD BEEN PICKED UP THERE WOULD BE NO MYSTERY AND NO NECESSITY FOR FURTHER POLICE INVESTIGATION. AND THE DETECTIVES ARE STILL HERE. I JUST SAW ONE. GEORGE. I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE. A FAMILY LIKE THAT CANNOT BE LEAGUED TOGETHER IN A CONSPIRACY TO HIDE THE TRUTH CONCERNING A MATTER SO SERIOUS. TO BE SURE THEY MAY ALL BE SHORT SIGHTED OR SO LITTLE GIVEN TO OBSERVATION THAT THEY DIDN'T SEE WHAT PASSED BEFORE THEIR EYES. THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT. I STOPPED SHORT SO SUDDENLY THAT GEORGE LOOKED STARTLED. MY ATTENTION HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY SOMETHING NEW I SAW IN THE MIRROR UPON WHICH MY ATTENTION WAS FIXED. A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING. HE WAS WATCHING THEM INTENTLY AND I THOUGHT I KNEW HIS FACE. I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FURTIVE WATCHER. A FELLOW TO MAKE YOU LAUGH. A PERFECT CHARACTER LAURA HIDEOUSLY HOMELY BUT AGREEABLE ENOUGH. I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY. I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW. VERY LIKELY HE'S DEEP IN THIS AFFAIR. JUST AN EVERYDAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH. NO HE ISN'T HOW QUICKLY HE DISAPPEARED. YES HE'S MERCURIAL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS. LAURA WE MUST GET OUT OF THIS. THERE HAPPENS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE IN THE WORLD FOR ME TO DO THAN TO SIT AROUND AND FOLLOW UP MURDER CLEWS. WHAT DOES HE WANT. I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE. HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME. THEN THEY STILL SUSPECT BROTHERSON THEY MUST. MY HEAD ROSE A TRIFLE AS I GLANCED UP AT GEORGE. THEN WE ARE NOT ALTOGETHER OUT OF IT. I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY. HE SMILED WHICH HARDLY SEEMED APROPOS
