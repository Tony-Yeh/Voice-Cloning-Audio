THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER. I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER. SO SAID THE OLD DETECTIVE THOUGHTFULLY. SWEETWATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS. HIS EYE WAS DULL AND HIS MANNER BETRAYED EXHAUSTION. BUT VIGOUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARKE AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR. BUT ONE POSSIBILITY REMAINS HE CONFIDED TO SWEETWATER AS THEY STOOD WAITING AT THE ELEVATOR DOOR. MISS CHALLONER DIED FROM A STAB. THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS. NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS. SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER. IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
