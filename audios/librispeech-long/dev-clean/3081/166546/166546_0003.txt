WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW. IT WAS FULL OF PEOPLE COMING AND GOING ON ALL SORTS OF BUSINESS AND PRESENTLY HE DREW BACK AND LEANING ON SWEETWATER'S ARM ASKED HIM A FEW QUESTIONS. WHO WERE THE FIRST TO RUSH IN HERE AFTER THE PARRISHES GAVE THE ALARM. ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL. THEY HAD JUST FINISHED THEIR PROGRAMME AND WERE PREPARING TO LEAVE THE GALLERY. NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST. GOOD THEIR NAMES. MARK SOWERBY AND CLAUS HENNERBERG. HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS. AND WHO FOLLOWED THEM. WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY. THEY HEARD THE DISTURBANCE AND RUSHED UP PELL MELL. WHO DID TOUCH HER. ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN. YES MISS CLARKE THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARRISHES. I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY. AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON. NO NEITHER SHE NOR ANY ONE ELSE AT THAT MOMENT SUSPECTED MURDER OR EVEN A VIOLENT DEATH. FATHER AND ALL YES. BUT THE BLOOD SURELY THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME SHOW OF BLOOD. THEY SAY NOT NO ONE NOTICED ANY. NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING. HE SAW THE DROPS AND UTTERED THE FIRST SUGGESTION OF MURDER. HOW LONG AFTER WAS THIS. IS THERE ANY ONE WHO HAS VENTURED TO MAKE AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF MINUTES WHICH ELAPSED FROM THE TIME SHE FELL TO THE MOMENT WHEN THE DOCTOR FIRST RAISED THE CRY OF MURDER. YES MISTER SLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED. TEN MINUTES AND NO BLOOD. THE WEAPON MUST STILL HAVE BEEN THERE SOME WEAPON WITH A SHORT AND INCONSPICUOUS HANDLE. I THINK THEY SAID THERE WERE FLOWERS OVER AND AROUND THE PLACE WHERE IT STRUCK. NOBODY NOTICED NOBODY LOOKED. A PANIC LIKE THAT SEEMS TO PARALYSE PEOPLE. TEN MINUTES. I MUST SEE EVERY ONE WHO APPROACHED HER DURING THOSE TEN MINUTES. EVERY ONE SWEETWATER AND I MUST MYSELF TALK WITH MISS CLARKE. YOU WILL LIKE HER. YOU WILL BELIEVE EVERY WORD SHE SAYS. NO DOUBT. ALL THE MORE REASON WHY I MUST SEE HER. SWEETWATER SOMEONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT. EFFECTS STILL HAVE THEIR CAUSES NOTWITHSTANDING THE NEW CULT. THE QUESTION IS WHO. THE STONES HAVE ALL BEEN TURNED OVER ONCE. BY YOU. NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME. THEN THEY WILL BEAR BEING TURNED OVER AGAIN. WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR. YOU SHALL HAVE THE USE OF THIS ELEVATOR. IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE. BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU. VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL. I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEUMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS. I'LL NOT TROUBLE HER MUCH. BUT THERE IS ONE POINT SHE MUST MAKE CLEAR TO ME. SWEETWATER DID NOT PRESUME TO ASK WHAT POINT BUT HE HOPED TO BE FULLY ENLIGHTENED WHEN THE TIME CAME. AND HE WAS
