WHY DOES GEORGE SOMETIMES SMILE WHEN I AM IN MY MOST SERIOUS MOODS. AS WE STEPPED OUT OF THE HOTEL GEORGE GAVE MY ARM A QUIET PINCH WHICH SERVED TO DIRECT MY ATTENTION TO AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WHO WAS JUST ALIGHTING FROM A TAXICAB AT THE KERB. HE MOVED HEAVILY AND WITH SOME APPEARANCE OF PAIN BUT FROM THE CROWD COLLECTED ON THE SIDEWALK MANY OF WHOM NUDGED EACH OTHER AS HE PASSED HE WAS EVIDENTLY A PERSON OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND AS HE DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE HOTEL ENTRANCE I ASKED GEORGE WHO THIS KIND FACED BRIGHT EYED OLD GENTLEMAN COULD BE. HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE. HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLUREMENT FOR HIM. THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN. I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AN EXPERIENCE TO SEE HIM AT WORK. I WOULDN'T HAVE MINDED THAT NOT ON MY OWN ACCOUNT THAT IS. HOWEVER THE OFFICE IS WAITING. COME LET ME PUT YOU ON THE CAR. THAT NIGHT I BIDED HIS COMING WITH AN IMPATIENCE I COULD NOT CONTROL. HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS. BEEN PUSHED ABOUT ALL DAY NO TIME FOR ANYTHING. THEN LET ME TELL YOU. BUT HE WOULD HAVE DINNER FIRST. HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT. MISTER GRYCE HAD MADE A DISCOVERY AND THE PAPERS WERE FULL OF IT. IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE. THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT. BUT LET ME TELL THE STORY OF THAT DAY WITHOUT ANY FURTHER REFERENCE TO MYSELF. THE OPINION HAD BECOME QUITE GENERAL WITH THOSE BEST ACQUAINTED WITH THE DETAILS OF THIS AFFAIR THAT THE MYSTERY WAS ONE OF THOSE ABNORMAL ONES FOR WHICH NO SOLUTION WOULD EVER BE FOUND WHEN THE AGED DETECTIVE SHOWED HIMSELF IN THE BUILDING AND WAS TAKEN TO THE ROOM WHERE AN INSPECTOR OF POLICE AWAITED HIM. THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED. THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM. I KNOW THAT IT WAS A GREAT DEAL TO ASK BUT WE'RE AT OUR WITS END AND SO I TELEPHONED. IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE. BUT CLEWS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE. THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN. AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE. I'VE KNOWN YOU MORE THAN ONCE TO SUCCEED WHERE OTHERS HAVE FAILED. I AM NOT WHAT I WAS. I CAN NO LONGER GET DOWN ON MY HANDS AND KNEES TO PICK UP THREADS FROM THE NAP OF A RUG OR SPY OUT A SPOT OF BLOOD IN THE CRIMSON WOOF OF A CARPET. YOU SHALL HAVE SWEETWATER HERE TO DO THE ACTIVE WORK FOR YOU. WHAT WE WANT OF YOU IS THE DIRECTING MIND THE INFALLIBLE INSTINCT. IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRYCE. WE'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING JUST LIKE IT. YOU'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE IT. IT WILL MAKE YOU YOUNG AGAIN
