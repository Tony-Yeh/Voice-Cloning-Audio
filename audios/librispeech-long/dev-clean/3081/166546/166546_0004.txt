MISTER GRYCE HAD UNDERTAKEN TO EDUCATE HIM FOR THIS WORK AND NEVER MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY OF GIVING HIM A LESSON. THE THREE MET IN A PRIVATE SITTING ROOM ON AN UPPER FLOOR THE DETECTIVES ENTERING FIRST AND THE LADY COMING IN SOON AFTER. AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE. HE WAS NOT LOOKING HER WAY OF COURSE HE NEVER LOOKED DIRECTLY AT ANYBODY BUT HE FORMED HIS IMPRESSIONS FOR ALL THAT AND SWEETWATER WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE SURE OF THESE IMPRESSIONS. THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE. MISS CLARKE WAS NOT A WOMAN TO ROUSE AN UNFAVOURABLE OPINION IN ANY MAN'S MIND. OF SLIGHT ALMOST FRAIL BUILD SHE HAD THAT PECULIAR ANIMATION WHICH GOES WITH A SPEAKING EYE AND A WIDELY SYMPATHETIC NATURE. MISTER GRYCE WAS ENGAGED AT THE MOMENT IN SHIFTING HIS CANE FROM THE RIGHT HAND TO THE LEFT BUT HIS MANNER WAS NEVER MORE ENCOURAGING OR HIS SMILE MORE BENEVOLENT. PARDON ME HE APOLOGISED WITH ONE OF HIS OLD FASHIONED BOWS I'M SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU AFTER ALL THE DISTRESS YOU MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER THIS MORNING. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING I WISH ESPECIALLY TO ASK YOU IN REGARD TO THE DREADFUL OCCURRENCE IN WHICH YOU PLAYED SO KIND A PART. YOU WERE THE FIRST TO REACH THE PROSTRATE WOMAN I BELIEVE. YES. THE BOYS JUMPED UP AND RAN TOWARDS HER BUT THEY WERE FRIGHTENED BY HER LOOKS AND LEFT IT FOR ME TO PUT MY HANDS UNDER HER AND TRY TO LIFT HER UP. DID YOU MANAGE IT. I SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HER HEAD INTO MY LAP NOTHING MORE. AND SAT SO. FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY. ONE THINKS SO FAST AT SUCH A TIME AND FEELS SO MUCH. YOU KNEW SHE WAS DEAD THEN. I FELT HER TO BE SO. YOU HAVE SEEN WOMEN IN A FAINT. YES MANY TIMES. WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. I CANNOT TELL YOU. PERHAPS THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON. PERHAPS THAT CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY YOU LAID YOUR PALM UPON HER HEART. MISS CLARKE STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY. THEN WITH A SUDDEN ACCESS OF FEELING I MAY HAVE DONE SO INDEED I BELIEVE I DID MY ARMS WERE AROUND HER IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN UNNATURAL ACTION. NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY. CANNOT YOU TELL ME POSITIVELY WHETHER YOU DID THIS OR NOT. YES I DID. AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION. I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW. DID I FEEL ANYTHING THERE BUT THE FLOWERS AND THE TULLE. NO MISTER GRYCE I DID NOT. THERE WAS NO PONIARD IN THE WOUND. MISTER GRYCE FELT AROUND FOUND A CHAIR AND SANK INTO IT. I THINK SO MISTER GRYCE. I WAS IN A STATE OF EXCITEMENT OF COURSE BUT THE WOMAN WAS A STRANGER TO ME AND MY FEELINGS WERE NOT UNDULY AGITATED. SWEETWATER WE CAN LET MY SUGGESTION GO IN REGARD TO THOSE TEN MINUTES I SPOKE OF
