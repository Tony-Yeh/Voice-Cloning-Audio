THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR. THEN HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF AND PAINFULLY LIFTED IT BACK AGAIN. WHAT ARE THE POINTS. WHAT'S THE DIFFICULTY HE ASKED. WE THOUGHT SHE HAD BEEN SHOT FOR THAT WAS INTELLIGIBLE AND INVOLVED NO IMPOSSIBILITIES. AS THE WOUND EXTENDS NO FURTHER THAN THE HEART THIS SETTLES ONE GREAT POINT AT LEAST. DOCTOR HEATH IS A RELIABLE MAN AND ONE OF OUR ABLEST CORONERS. YES THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION AS TO THE TRUTH OF HIS REPORT. YOU KNOW THE VICTIM HER NAME I MEAN AND THE CHARACTER SHE BORE. YES SO MUCH WAS TOLD ME ON MY WAY DOWN. A FINE GIRL UNSPOILED BY RICHES AND SEEMING INDEPENDENCE. SUICIDE BY STABBING CALLS FOR A WEAPON. STABBED WHILE BY HERSELF OR WHAT YOU MAY CALL BY HERSELF. SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER. NONE IF WE CAN BELIEVE THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE PARRISH FAMILY WHO WERE SEATED AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM. THEY NEVER KNEW THE WOMAN FATHER MAIDEN AUNT AND TWO BOYS CLEAR EYED JOLLY YOUNG CHAPS WHOM EVEN THE HORROR OF THIS TRAGEDY PERPETRATED AS IT WERE UNDER THEIR VERY NOSE CANNOT MAKE SERIOUS FOR MORE THAN A PASSING MOMENT. IT WOULDN'T SEEM SO. SO THEY TELL ME. SHE FELL JUST A FEW FEET FROM THE DESK WHERE SHE HAD BEEN WRITING. NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL. IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN. BUT IT WAS A BOLT WHICH DREW BLOOD NOT MUCH BLOOD I HEAR BUT SUFFICIENT TO END LIFE ALMOST INSTANTLY. SHE NEVER LOOKED UP OR SPOKE AGAIN. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRYCE. I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL. A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD. HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE. WILL YOU TAKE MY ARM SIR. MISTER GRYCE'S WHOLE FACE BRIGHTENED. THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE. HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE AT THIS THING HE ASKED. BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY. YES SIR THEY WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO ALLOW IT. VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIONEER ME. YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL AND WON'T BE IN A HURRY. NO I'M AT THE END OF MY ROPE I HAVEN'T AN IDEA SIR. WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS. THEN AS HE SLOWLY ROSE WITH THE OTHER'S CAREFUL ASSISTANCE THERE'S NO CRIME WITHOUT ITS CLEW. THE THING IS TO RECOGNISE THAT CLEW WHEN SEEN. BUT I'M IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES. OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING. NEVERTHELESS HE LOOKED TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN WHEN HE CAME IN OR SO THOUGHT THOSE WHO KNEW HIM. CONSEQUENTLY THE TWO REMAINED QUITE UNINTERRUPTED WHILE THEY MOVED ABOUT THE PLACE IN QUIET CONSULTATION. OTHERS HAD PRECEDED THEM HAD EXAMINED THE PLAIN LITTLE DESK AND FOUND NOTHING HAD PACED OFF THE DISTANCES HAD LOOKED WITH LONGING AND INQUIRING EYES AT THE ELEVATOR CAGE AND THE OPEN ARCHWAY LEADING TO THE LITTLE STAIRCASE AND THE MUSICIANS GALLERY. BUT THIS WAS NOTHING TO THE OLD DETECTIVE. THE LOCALE WAS WHAT HE WANTED AND HE GOT IT
