IT WAS THE CHINAMAN PONG SOUNDING HIS CALL FOR BREAKFAST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE USAGE OF THE PLAINS. GRUB PI LE HE FINISHED IN A LOWER TONE AFTER WHICH HIS HEAD QUICKLY DISAPPEARED UNDER THE COVER OF THE WAGON. BY THE TIME THE COWMEN AND PONY RIDERS HAD REFRESHED THEMSELVES AT THE SPRING NEAR WHICH THE OUTFIT HAD CAMPED A STEAMING HOT BREAKFAST HAD BEEN SPREAD ON THE GROUND WITH A SLICKER FOR A TABLE CLOTH. THREE COWBOYS FELL TO WITH A WILL GULPING DOWN THEIR BREAKFAST IN A HURRY THAT THEY MIGHT RIDE OUT AND RELIEVE THE FOURTH GUARD ON THE HERD. YOU BOYS DON'T HAVE TO SWALLOW YOUR FOOD WHOLE SMILED THE FOREMAN OBSERVING THAT THE PONY RIDERS SEEMED TO THINK THEY WERE EXPECTED TO HURRY THROUGH THEIR MEAL AS WELL THOSE FELLOWS HAVE TO GO OUT. TAKE YOUR TIME THE FOURTH GUARD HAS TO EAT YET SO THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME HOW DID YOU ALL SLEEP. FINE CHORUSED THE BOYS. AND YOU MISTER PROFESSOR SURPRISINGLY WELL. IT IS ASTONISHING WITH HOW LITTLE A MAN CAN GET ALONG WHEN HE HAS TO. WHO IS THE WRANGLER THIS MORNING ASKED THE FOREMAN GLANCING ABOUT AT HIS MEN. I AM SPOKE UP SHORTY SAVAGE PROMPTLY WRANGLER. A WRANGLER'S A WRANGLER ANSWERED BIG FOOT STOLIDLY. HE'S A FELLOW WHO'S ALL THE TIME MAKING TROUBLE ISN'T HE ASKED STACY INNOCENTLY. OH NO THIS KIND OF A WRANGLER ISN'T LAUGHED THE FOREMAN. THE TROUBLE IS USUALLY MADE FOR HIM AND IT'S SERVED UP HOT OFF THE SPIDER. THE HORSE WRANGLER IS THE FELLOW WHO GOES OUT AND ROUNDS UP THE PONIES SOMETIMES HE DOES IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING ARE SMASHING ABOUT HIM LIKE ALL POSSESSED AND THE CATTLE ARE ON THE RAMPAGE. HE'S A TROUBLE CURER NOT A TROUBLEMAKER EXCEPT FOR HIMSELF. I GUESS THERE ARE SOME WORDS THAT AREN'T IN THE DICTIONARY LAUGHED TAD. THE MEAL WAS SOON FINISHED PONG HAVING STOOD RUBBING HIS PALMS A HAPPY SMILE ON HIS FACE DURING THE TIME THEY WERE EATING. A VERY FINE BREAKFAST SIR ANNOUNCED THE PROFESSOR LOOKING UP AT THE CHINAMAN. PONG TELL THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU IF YOU WERE TO SERVE BAD MEALS TO THIS OUTFIT OF COWPUNCHERS. THE CHINAMAN SHOWED TWO ROWS OF WHITE TEETH IN HIS EXPANSIVE GRIN. ALLEE SAME LIKEE THIS HE EXPLAINED. HOW ASKED TAD. PONG GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF DRAWING A GUN FROM HIS BELT AND PUFFING OUT HIS CHEEKS UTTERED AN EXPLOSIVE POUF. I GUESS WE ARE PRETTY SURE OF HAVING REAL FOOD TO EAT THEN LAUGHED TAD AS THE BOYS ROSE FROM THE TABLE READY FOR THE ACTIVE WORK OF THE DAY. WE WILL NOW GET TO WORK ON THE HERD ANNOUNCED THE FOREMAN. WE HAD BETTER START THE DRIVE THIS MORNING. WHEN WE MAKE CAMP AT NOON WE WILL CUT OUT THE STRAYS. I TRUST NONE OF YOU WILL BE IMPRUDENT AND GET INTO TROUBLE FOR WE SHALL HAVE OTHER THINGS TO LOOK AFTER TO DAY
