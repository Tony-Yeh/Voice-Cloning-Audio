STACY GRUMBLED TURNED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN. THE GUARD CHANCED TO BE LUMPY BATES AND HE ADMINISTERED WHAT TO HIM WAS A GENTLE KICK TO HURRY THE BOY ALONG OUCH YELLED CHUNKY SITTING UP AND RUBBING HIS EYES. KEEP STILL YOU BABY GROWLED THE COWMAN. DO YOU WANT TO WAKE UP THE WHOLE OUTFIT. THERE'LL BE A LIVELY MUSS ABOUT THE TIME YOU DO I RECKON AND YOU'LL WISH YOU HADN'T. IF YOU CAN'T KEEP SHUT THE BOSS'LL BE FOR MAKING YOU SLEEP UNDER THE CHUCK WAGON. IF YOU MAKE A RACKET THERE PONG WILL DUMP A POT OF BOILING WATER OVER YOU. YOU WON'T BE SO FAST TO WAKE UP HARD WORKING COWBOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON. IS BREAKFAST READY ASKED THE BOY TIGHTENING HIS BELT AND JAMMING HIS SOMBRERO DOWN OVER HIS HEAD. BREAKFAST JEERED LUMPY. YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE IN THIS OUTFIT LET ALONE FILLING YOURSELF WITH GRUB GET OUT. STACY RUEFULLY AND STILL HALF ASLEEP MADE A WIDE CIRCLE AROUND THE SLEEPING COWMEN THAT HE MIGHT NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF AGAIN STEPPING ON ANY OF THEM. LUMPY WATCHED HIM WITH DISAPPROVING EYES. THE LAD CAUGHT THE PONY THAT STOOD MOPING IN THE CORRAL NOT APPEARING TO BE AWARE THAT HIS RIDER WAS PREPARING HIM FOR THE RANGE CHUNKY ALL THE TIME MUTTERING TO HIMSELF. LEADING THE PONY OUT THE BOY GATHERED UP THE REINS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ANIMAL AND PREPARED TO MOUNT. LUMPY BATES CAME RUNNING TOWARD HIM NOT DARING TO CALL OUT FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE CAMP. THE COWMAN WAS SWINGING HIS ARMS AND SEEKING TO ATTRACT THE LAD'S ATTENTION. CHUNKY HOWEVER WAS TOO SLEEPY TO SEE ANYTHING SO SMALL AS A COWMAN SWINGING HIS ARMS A ROD AWAY. HI THERE HISSED LUMPY FILLED WITH INDIGNATION THAT ANYONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A PONY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE. HIS WARNING CAME TOO LATE. STACY BROWN'S LEFT LEG SWUNG OVER THE SADDLE. NO SOONER HAD THE PONY FELT THE LEATHER OVER HIM THAN HE RAISED HIS BACK STRAIGHT UP HIS HEAD GOING DOWN ALMOST TO THE GROUND. STACY SHOT UP INTO THE AIR AS IF HE HAD BEEN PROPELLED FROM A BOW GUN. HE STRUCK THE SOFT SAND SEVERAL FEET IN ADVANCE OF THE PONY HIS FACE AND HEAD PLOUGHING A LITTLE FURROW AS HE DROVE ALONG ON HIS NOSE. HE HAD NO MORE THAN STRUCK HOWEVER BEFORE THE IRATE COWBOY HAD HIM BY THE COLLAR AND HAD JERKED THE LAD TO HIS FEET YOU TENDERFOOT HE SNARLED ACCENTING THE WORDS SO THAT THEY CARRIED A WORLD OF MEANING WITH THEM. HE SHOOK THE LAD VIOLENTLY. DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. THE COWBOY JERKED HIS OWN HEAD UP AND DOWN AS IF THE WORDS HE WOULD UTTER HAD WEDGED FAST IN HIS THROAT. GIT OUT OF HERE BEFORE I SAY SOMETHING. THE BOSS SAID THE FIRST MAN HE HEARD USING LANGUAGE WHILE YOU TENDERFEET WERE WITH US WOULD GET FIRED ON THE SPOT. WITHOUT TAKING THE CHANCE OF WAITING UNTIL STACY HAD MOUNTED THE PONY LUMPY GRABBED THE BOY AND TOSSED HIM INTO THE SADDLE GIVING THE LITTLE ANIMAL A SHARP SLAP ON THE FLANK AS HE DID SO. AT FIRST THE PONY BEGAN TO BUCK THEN EVIDENTLY THINKING THE EFFORT WAS NOT WORTH WHILE SETTLED DOWN TO A ROUGH TROT WHICH SOON SHOOK THE BOY UP AND THOROUGHLY AWAKENED HIM. THE REST OF THE FOURTH GUARD HAD ALREADY GONE OUT CHUNKY MEETING THE RETURNING MEMBERS OF THE THIRD COMING IN. BETTER HURRY UP KID THEY CHUCKLED THE COWS'LL SLEEP THEMSELVES OUT OF SIGHT BEFORE YOU GET THERE IF YOU DON'T GET A MOVE ON. WHERE ARE THEY ASKED THE BOY. KEEP A GOING AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL RUN PLUMB INTO THEM WAS THE JEERING ANSWER AS THE SLEEPY COWMEN SPURRED THEIR PONIES ON TOWARD CAMP MUTTERING THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF TAKING ALONG A BUNCH OF BOYS ON A CATTLE DRIVE. IN A FEW MOMENTS THEY TOO HAD TURNED THEIR PONIES ADRIFT AND HAD THROWN THEMSELVES DOWN BESIDE THEIR COMPANIONS PULLING THEIR BLANKETS WELL ABOUT THEM FOR THE NIGHT HAD GROWN CHILL. OUT ON THE PLAINS THE FOURTH GUARD WERE DROWSILY CROONING THE LULLABY ABOUT THE BULL THAT CAME DOWN THE HILLSIDE LONG TIME AGO. IT SEEMED AS IF SCARCELY A MINUTE HAD PASSED SINCE THE BOYS TURNED IN BEFORE THEY WERE AWAKENED BY THE STRIDENT TONES OF THE FOREMAN. ALMOST BEFORE THE ECHOES OF HIS VOICE HAD DIED AWAY A SHRILL VOICE PIPED UP FROM THE TAIL END OF THE CHUCK WAGON. GRUB PI LE GRUB PI LE
