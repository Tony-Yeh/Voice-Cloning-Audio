CHAPTER FOUR THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP. THE CAMP FIRE WAS BURNING BRIGHTLY WHEN THE FIRST GUARD HAVING COMPLETED ITS TOUR OF DUTY CAME GALLOPING IN IN A FEW MOMENTS THE SOUND OF SINGING WAS BORNE TO THE EARS OF THE CAMPERS. WHAT'S THE NOISE DEMANDED STACY BROWN SITTING UP WITH A HALF SCARED LOOK ON HIS FACE. IT'S THE COWBOY'S LAMENT LAUGHED BOB STALLINGS LISTEN. OFF ON THE PLAIN THEY HEARD A RICH TENOR VOICE RAISED IN THE SONG OF THE COWMAN. LITTLE BLACK BULL CAME DOWN THE HILLSIDE DOWN THE HILLSIDE DOWN THE HILLSIDE LITTLE BLACK BULL CAME DOWN THE HILLSIDE LONG TIME AGO. I DON'T CALL THAT MUCH OF A SONG SNIFFED CHUNKY CONTEMPTUOUSLY AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE GROUP. EVEN IF I CAN'T SING I CAN BEAT THAT. BETTER NOT TRY IT OUT ON THE RANGE SMILED THE FOREMAN. NOT ON THE RANGE WHY NOT DEMANDED THE BOY. BOB THINKS IT MIGHT STAMPEDE THE HERD SPOKE UP BIG FOOT SANDERS. A LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED AT CHUNKY'S EXPENSE. WHEN YOU GET TO BE HALF AS GOOD A MAN ON COWS AS YOUR FRIEND THE PINTO HERE YOU'LL BE A FULL GROWN MAN ADDED BIG FOOT THE PINTO ROUNDED UP A BUNCH OF STRAY COWS TO NIGHT AS WELL AS I COULD DO IT MYSELF AND HE DIDN'T GO ABOUT IT WITH A BRASS BAND EITHER. THE FOREMAN NODDED WITH AN APPROVING GLANCE AT TAD. TAD'S EYES WERE SPARKLING FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF THE EVENING AS WELL AS FROM THE PRAISE BESTOWED UPON HIM BY THE BIG COWPUNCHER. THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO IT. MORE THAN MOST TENDERFEET WOULD HAVE DONE GROWLED BIG FOOT. WALTER HAD GONE OUT WITH THE SECOND GUARD AND THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED AROUND THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR NIGHTLY STORY TELLING. NOW I DON'T WANT YOU FELLOWS SITTING UP ALL NIGHT OBJECTED THE FOREMAN. NONE OF YOU WILL BE FIT FOR DUTY TO MORROW. WE'VE GOT A HARD DRIVE BEFORE US AND EVERY MAN MUST BE FIT AS A FIDDLE. YOU CAN ENJOY YOURSELVES SLEEPING JUST AS WELL AS SITTING UP. HUMPH GRUNTED CURLEY ADAMS. I'LL GIVE IT AS A HORSEBACK OPINION THAT THE ONLY WAY TO ENJOY SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS IS TO SIT UP UNTIL YOU FALL ASLEEP WITH YOUR BOOTS ON. THAT'S THE WAY I'M GOING TO DO IT TO NIGHT. THE COWBOY DID THIS VERY THING BUT WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAVING TURNED IN ONE BY ONE. WHERE ARE YOUR BEDS ASKED STACY AFTER THE FOREMAN HAD URGED THE BOYS TO GET TO SLEEP. BEDS GRUNTED BIG FOOT. ANYWHERE EVERYWHERE. OUR BEDS ON THE PLAINS ARE WHEREVER WE HAPPEN TO PULL OUR BOOTS OFF. YOU WILL FIND YOUR STUFF ROLLED UP UNDER THE CHUCK WAGON BOYS SAID STALLINGS. I HAD PONG GET OUT THE BLANKETS FOR YOU SEEING THAT YOU HAVE ONLY YOUR SLICKERS WITH YOU. THE LADS FOUND THAT A PAIR OF BLANKETS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THEM WITH AN ORDINARY WAGON SHEET DOUBLED FOR A TARPAULIN. THESE THEY SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND USING BOOTS WRAPPED IN COATS FOR PILLOWS. STACY BROWN PROVED THE ONLY GRUMBLER IN THE LOT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP A WINK ON SUCH A BED AS THAT. IN FLOUNDERING ABOUT MAKING UP HIS BUNK THE LAD HAD FALLEN OVER TWO COWBOYS AND STEPPED FULL ON THE FACE OF A THIRD. INSTANTLY THERE WAS A CHORUS OF YELLS AND SNARLS FROM THE DISTURBED COWPUNCHERS ACCOMPANIED BY DIRE THREATS AS TO WHAT THEY WOULD DO TO THE GOPHER DID HE EVER DISTURB THEIR REST IN THAT WAY AGAIN. THIS EFFECTUALLY QUIETED THE BOY FOR THE NIGHT AND THE CAMP SETTLED DOWN TO SILENCE AND TO SLEEP. THE HORSES OF THE OUTFIT SAVE THOSE THAT WERE ON NIGHT DUTY AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF STRAYING HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR ANIMALS ON THE TRAIL ARE SELDOM STAKED DOWN. FOR THESE A ROPE HAD BEEN STRUNG FROM A REAR WHEEL OF THE WAGON AND ANOTHER FROM THE END OF THE TONGUE BACK TO A STAKE DRIVEN IN THE GROUND THUS FORMING A TRIANGULAR CORRAL. BESIDES HOLDING THE UNTRUSTWORTHY HORSES IT AFFORDED A TEMPORARY CORRAL FOR CATCHING A CHANGE OF MOUNTS. IN SPITE OF THEIR HARD COUCHES THE PONY RIDERS SLEPT SOUNDLY EVEN PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN HIMSELF NEVER WAKING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH. NED RECTOR HAD COME UP SMILING WHEN AWAKENED FOR HIS TRICK ON THE THIRD GUARD. WITH STACY BROWN HOWEVER SEVERE MEASURES WERE NECESSARY WHEN ONE OF THE RETURNING GUARD ROUTED HIM OUT AT HALF PAST THREE IN THE MORNING
