A MOMENT MORE AND HE TOO CAUGHT THE PLAINTIVE CRY FOR HELP FROM BELOW. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THUS FAR ON THE JOURNEY THAT LIGE THOMAS HAD MANIFESTED THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF EXCITEMENT. JUST NOW HOWEVER THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT HE WAS INTENSELY AGITATED. YOU'LL ALL BE OVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CARE. IT'S MASTER WALT SNAPPED THE GUIDE STAND STILL DON'T MOVE AN INCH. I'M GOING BACK FOR A TORCH HE COMMANDED LEAPING BY THEM ON HIS WAY TO THE CAMP FIRE. DOWN THERE SIR EXPLAINED TAD POINTING TO THE LEDGE OF ROCK OVER WHICH WALTER HAD FALLEN. I KNOW I KNOW BUT. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET HIM. THE SHOUT OF JOY THAT HAD FRAMED ITSELF ON THE LIPS OF NED RECTOR AND STACY BROWN DIED OUT IN AN INDISTINCT MURMUR IS IT POSSIBLE. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO THOMAS HOW ARE WE TO RESCUE THE BOY. SEE ANYTHING ASKED TAD TREMULOUSLY CREEPING TO HIS SIDE. LOOKS LIKE A CLUMP OF BUSHES DOWN THERE BUT I AIN'T SURE CAN YOU MAKE IT OUT. NO ALL I CAN SEE IS ROCKS AND SHADOWS. WHERE IS IT THAT YOU THINK YOU SEE BUSHES. OVER THERE TO THE RIGHT JUST NEAR THE EDGE OF THE LIGHT SPACE MADE BY THE TORCH LIGHT ANSWERED THE GUIDE. YES AGREED TAD THAT DOES LOOK LIKE BUSHES. I'LL CALL TO WALTER AND TELL HIM WE ARE COMING. HEY WALTER WHERE ARE YOU. DON'T MOVE AROUND LIE PERFECTLY STILL WARNED THE GUIDE ARE YOU HURT. TO THIS QUESTION WALTER MADE SOME REPLY THAT WAS UNINTELLIGIBLE TO THEM. NOW WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO I'D LIKE TO KNOW ASKED NED. I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED LIGE FROWNING THOUGHTFULLY IT'S A TOUGH JOB. IF I HAD A COUPLE OF MOUNTAINEERS WHO KNEW THEIR BUSINESS WE'D STAND A BETTER CHANCE OF PULLING HIM UP. WHY NOT GET A ROPE AND LET IT DOWN TO HIM SUGGESTED TAD. YES THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO IT. RUN OVER TO THE COOK TENT AND TELL JOSE TO GIVE YOU THOSE RAWHIDE LARIATS THAT HE WILL FIND BEHIND HIS BUNK HURRY. TAD WAS OFF ALMOST BEFORE THE WORDS WERE OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE GUIDE AND IN THE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE TIME CAME RACING BACK WITH THE LEATHER COILS WHICH HE TOSSED TO LIGE BEFORE REACHING HIM THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE EVEN A SECOND'S DELAY. THE MOUNTAINEER QUICKLY FORMED A LOOP IN ONE END OF THE ROPE MAKING IT LARGE ENOUGH TO PERMIT OF ITS SLIPPING OVER THE SHOULDERS OF A MAN. THEY GAZED AT EACH OTHER IN PERPLEXITY. NO WE SHOULD HAVE HEARD HIM IF HE HAD ANSWERED LIGE. IF I COULD SEE HIM I'D LASSO HIM AND HAUL HIM UP BUT I DON'T DARE TRY IT. THEN AGAIN THESE ROOTS ON A WALL OF ROCK AIN'T ANY TOO STRONG USUALLY. I DON'T DARE TRY ANY EXPERIMENTS. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS HAPPENED TO HIM ASKED TAD IN A TROUBLED VOICE. FAINTED PROBABLY HE AIN'T VERY STRONG YOU KNOW. AND THAT TUMBLE'S ENOUGH TO KNOCK THE SENSE OUT OF A FULL GROWN MAN. WE'VE GOT TO GET WALT UP HERE EVEN IF I HAVE TO JUMP OVER AFTER HIM SAID TAD FIRMLY. RIGHT YOU ARE YOUNG MAN BUT TALKING WON'T DO IT. SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO WILL BE NECESSARY WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN REACH HIM EXPLAINED LIGE DANGLING THE LOOP OF THE LARIAT IN HIS HANDS AS HE LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER. IN THAT CASE YOU WILL HAVE TO GO YOURSELF THOMAS DECIDED THE PROFESSOR SHARPLY. I COULD NOT THINK OF ALLOWING ANY OF MY CHARGES TO TAKE SO TERRIBLE A RISK AND. LET ME GO MISTER THOMAS INTERRUPTED NED RECTOR STEPPING FORWARD WITH ALMOST A CHALLENGE IN HIS EYES. NO I AM THE LIGHTER OF THE TWO URGED TAD. I AM THE ONE TO GO AFTER WALT IF ANYONE HAS TO I'LL GO DOWN MISTER THOMAS. MASTER TAD IS RIGHT DECIDED THE GUIDE GAZING AT THE TWO BOYS APPROVINGLY. IT WILL BE BETTER FOR HIM TO GO IF HE WILL. AND HE MOST CERTAINLY WILL INTERRUPTED TAD ADVANCING A STEP. I PROTEST SHOUTED THE PROFESSOR. YOU YOURSELF SHOULD GO LIGE YOU ARE. I AM NEEDED RIGHT HERE SIR REPLIED THE GUIDE SHORTLY. YOU'D HAVE BOTH OF US AT THE BOTTOM IF I LEFT IT TO YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THIS END. THE GUIDE WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AND GIVING NO HEED TO PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN'S NERVOUS PROTESTS SLIPPED THE NOOSE OVER TAD'S SHOULDERS AND DRAWING IT DOWN AND UP UNDER HIS ARMS SECURED THE KNOT SO THAT THE LOOP MIGHT NOT TIGHTEN UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE BOY'S BODY. NOW BE VERY CAREFUL MAKE NO SUDDEN MOVES. AND IF YOU MEET WITH ANYTHING UNLOOKED FOR LET ME KNOW AT ONCE
