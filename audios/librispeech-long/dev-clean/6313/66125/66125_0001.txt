YOU KNOW YOU WILL HAVE TO STAY DOWN THERE WHILE WE ARE DRAWING THE BOY UP. BUT BEFORE REMOVING THE ROPE FROM YOUR OWN BODY MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE SAFE. IF YOU FIND THE SUPPORT TOO WEAK TO BEAR YOUR WEIGHT LET ME KNOW. I'LL SEND DOWN ANOTHER ROPE TO WHICH YOU CAN TIE YOURSELF UNTIL WE GET MASTER WALTER TO THE TOP. BE SURE TO FASTEN HIM SECURELY TO THE LOOP BEFORE YOU GIVE THE SIGNAL TO HAUL UP WARNED THE GUIDE. HERE PUT MY GUN IN YOUR POCKET I UNDERSTAND. ARE YOU READY YES. TAD TOSSED AWAY HIS SOMBRERO AND SAT DOWN ON A SHELF OF ROCK AT THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF HIS FEET DANGLING OVER. THE LAD'S FACE WAS PALE THE LINES ON IT STANDING OUT IN SHARP RIDGES BUT NOT BY SO MUCH AS THE FLICKER OF AN EYELID DID HE BETRAY THE SLIGHTEST NERVOUSNESS. YET TAD BUTLER REALIZED FULLY THE PERILOUS NATURE OF HIS UNDERTAKING AND THAT THE LEAST MISTAKE ON HIS PART OR ON THE PART OF THOSE ABOVE HIM MIGHT MEAN A SUDDEN END TO HIS EARTHLY AMBITIONS. LIGE SHORTENED THE HITCH ABOUT THE TREE UNTIL THE LINE DREW TAUT. AFTER WINDING THE END TIGHTLY ABOUT HIS OWN ARM HE HANDED A LIGHTED TORCH TO TAD. RIGHT ANNOUNCED THE GUIDE IN A REASSURING VOICE. GOOD APPROVED LIGE ENCOURAGINGLY BEGINNING TO LET THE RAWHIDE SLIP SLOWLY AROUND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE. AS HE DID SO TAD FELT HIMSELF GRADUALLY SINKING INTO THE SOMBRE DEPTHS. HE TILTED HIS HEAD TO LOOK UP. THE MOVEMENT SENT HIS BODY SWAYING GIDDILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE. CAUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCKS TO STEADY HIMSELF TAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT WOULD NOT PAY TO BE TOO CURIOUS. BETTER LIE DOWN SO YOU TOO DON'T TAKE A NOTION TO FALL OFF. KEEP YOUR EYES SHUT TILL I TELL YOU TO OPEN THEM. SLOWLY BUT STEADILY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID A TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CANYOU. AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM HOURS A SHARP CALL FROM THE DEPTHS REACHED THEIR EARS. LIGE QUICKLY MADE FAST THE LINE TO A TREE. YES GOT HIM HE ANSWERED LEANING OVER THE CLIFF. I SEE HIM CALLED TAD HIS VOICE SOUNDING HOLLOW AND UNNATURAL TO THOSE ABOVE. HE'S SO FAR TO THE RIGHT OF ME THAT I CAN'T REACH HIM. WILL IT BE ALL RIGHT FOR ME TO SWING MYSELF WHERE IS HE. LODGED IN THE BRANCHES OF A PINYON TREE I THINK IT IS BUT HE DOESN'T ANSWER ME. WAIT A MINUTE CAUTIONED THE MOUNTAINEER. LIGE SEARCHED UNTIL HE FOUND A LIMB SOME THREE INCHES IN DIAMETER AND THIS HE PLACED UNDER THE ROPE SO AS TO RELIEVE THE STRAIN OF THE ROCK UPON IT THAT THERE MIGHT BE NO DANGER OF THE LEATHER BEING SAWED IN TWO BY CONTACT WITH THE LEDGE. ALL RIGHT NOW TRY IT. THE CREAKING OF THE RAWHIDE TOLD THEM THAT TAD BUTLER WAS SWAYING FROM SIDE TO SIDE FIFTY FEET BELOW THEM AT THE END OF A SLENDER LINE. LIGE LEANING OVER THE BRINK WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THE BOY'S MOVEMENTS BY THE AID OF THE THIN ARC OF LIGHT MADE BY THE TORCH IN TAD'S HAND. THEN FOLLOWED A LONG PERIOD OF SUSPENSE. BUT FROM THE CAUTIOUS MOVEMENTS OF THE LIGHT FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY. WHY DOESN'T HE SAY SOMETHING CRIED THE PROFESSOR UNABLE TO RESTRAIN HIS IMPATIENCE LONGER HIS OVERWROUGHT NERVES ALMOST AT THE BREAKING POINT. KEEP STILL DON'T BOTHER HIM THE BOY'S DOING THE BEST HE CAN. MEBBY YOU THINK HE'S HAVING SOME SORT OF A PICNIC DOWN THERE EH GLARED LIGE. TAD'S VOICE NOW STRONG AND CLEAR ROSE FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE CANYOU. SHALL WE HAUL UP ASKED LIGE MAKING A MEGAPHONE OF HIS HANDS YES HAUL AWAY. TELL THEM WALT'S ALL RIGHT HE CAN TALK NOW WAS THE ANSWER THAT CARRIED WITH IT SUCH A NOTE OF GLADNESS THAT NED AND STACY WERE UNABLE TO RESIST A SHOUT OF JOY. LEND A HAND HERE COMMANDED LIGE TAKING FIRM HOLD OF THE LINE AND STEPPING TO THE EDGE THAT HE MIGHT COMMAND BOTH ENDS OF THE OPERATION. ARE YOU ALL SAFE DOWN THERE TAD. SURE THING ANSWERED THE BOY. VERY SLOWLY RESTRAINING THEIR INCLINATION TO HAUL THE ROPE IN WITH ALL SPEED ONLY BECAUSE THE WARNING EYES OF THE GUIDE WERE UPON THEM THE TWO BOYS ASSISTED BY PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN BEGAN HOISTING WALTER PERKINS TOWARD THE TOP
