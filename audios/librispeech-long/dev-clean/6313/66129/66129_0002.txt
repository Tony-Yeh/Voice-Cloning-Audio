THE FIRST TIME HE RODE SWIFTLY BY IT LEANING OVER TO LOOK AT THE HAT AS HE PASSED HOLDING TO THE POMMEL FIRMLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND. STACY DISMOUNTED AND REMOVED THE HAT CAREFULLY TO ONE SIDE. WHAT'S THAT FOR DEMANDED NED WONDERINGLY. HAT TOO CLOSE TO ME I COULDN'T GET IT EXPLAINED CHUNKY THE BOYS ROARED. WHY DON'T YOU MOVE THE PONY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE THE HAT YOU NINNY. ONCE MORE STACY APPROACHED THE SOMBRERO HIS PONY RUNNING WELL AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN HIS SADDLE JUST AS TAD BUTLER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE. BY GEORGE HE'S GOING TO TRY IT EXCLAIMED NED. BE CAREFUL CHUNKY WARNED WALTER. HE'S GOT TO LEARN DECLARED TAD. THEN CHUNKY ESSAYED THE FEAT. AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE FREED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP HE THREW HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO GRASP THE POMMEL. AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN HE REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING. FORTUNATELY HIS RIGHT FOOT FREED ITSELF FROM THE STIRRUP AT THE SAME TIME OR THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT ENDING. CHUNKY TURNED A DOUBLE SOMERSAULT LAY STILL FOR A MOMENT THEN STRUGGLED UP RUBBING HIS BODY GINGERLY AS THE REST OF THE PARTY CAME HURRYING UP TO HIM. ARE YOU HURT ASKED TAD APPREHENSIVELY
