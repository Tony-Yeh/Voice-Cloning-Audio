BUT PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN ADVISED THEM TO REMAIN WHERE THEY WERE AND GET THE FIRE GOING IN CASE LIGE HAD FAILED TO FIND THE PACK TRAIN. HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME KIND WITH HIM. THE FIRE WOULD BE READY AND THUS NO TIME WOULD BE LOST IN PREPARING THE FIRST MEAL OF THE DAY WHICH IN THIS CASE WOULD BE BREAKFAST DINNER AND SUPPER ALL IN ONE. THE BOYS AWAITED THE GUIDE'S APPROACH WITH IMPATIENCE SOME PACING BACK AND FORTH WHILE OTHERS COAXED THE FIRE INTO A ROARING BLAZE AT THE SAME TIME CONFIDING TO EACH OTHER HOW HUNGRY THEY WERE. NOW YOU MAY GO HE NODDED. WITH A SHOUT THE BOYS DASHED PELL MELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BURROS URGED THEM ON WITH DERISIVE SHOUTS AND SUNDRY RESOUNDING SLAPS ON THE ANIMALS FLANKS. HAD ANYTHING TO EAT ASKED THE GUIDE. NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE US INDIGESTION ANSWERED NED. COLD WATER IS THE MOST NOURISHING THING WE'VE TOUCHED SINCE LAST NIGHT. BUT I LEFT YOU A RABBIT DIDN'T YOU FIND IT. WE DID NOT IT MUST HAVE COME TO LIFE SOME TIME DURING THE NIGHT AND DUG ITS WAY OUT LAUGHED TAD. AND WE'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU ANNOUNCED STACY SWELLING WITH PRIDE. WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT LAUGHED THE GUIDE. YOU'LL SEE WHEN YOU GET TO CAMP ANSWERED CHUNKY. I DON'T NEED GUNS TO HUNT WITH A STOUT CLUB FOR MINE. AFTER HAVING SHOWN THE CAT TO LIGE AND GETTING HIS PROMISE TO TEACH THEM HOW TO SKIN IT THE BOYS SET TO WITH A WILL TO ASSIST IN THE UNPACKING. CHUNKY REACHED THE TABLE FIRST GREEDILY SURVEYING WHAT HAD BEEN PLACED ON IT. WHY MISTER THOMAS WHERE DID YOU GET HONEY ASKED WALTER. FOUND A BEE TREE ON MY WAY BACK AND CUT IT DOWN. I THINK YOU WILL FIND THERE IS ENOUGH OF IT TO DOUBLE YOU ALL UP GRINNED LIGE. WE'LL TAKE ALL CHANCES ADVISED NED. BUT WHAT'S THIS IT LOOKS LIKE JAM. JAM EXCLAIMED CHUNKY STRETCHING HIS NECK AND EYEING THE DISH LONGINGLY. YES WILD PLUM JAM ANSWERED THE GUIDE WOW CHUCKLED STACY UNDER HIS BREATH. NOW FALL TO YOUNG GENTLEMEN DIRECTED THE PROFESSOR. I AM FREE TO ADMIT THAT I AM HUNGRY TOO. I THINK I SHALL HELP MYSELF TO SOME OF THAT WILD PLUM JAM AND BISCUIT FIRST IT REMINDS ME OF OLD TIMES. WE SOMETIMES HAD JAM WHEN I WAS WITH THE GERMAN. ARMY ADDED NED YES. BUT THE PROFESSOR WAS LOST IN HIS ENJOYMENT OF THE BISCUIT WHICH HE HAD LIBERALLY SMEARED WITH THE DELICIOUS JAM. CHUNKY DID EVEN BETTER THAN THAT. HE BURIED HIS BISCUIT UNDER A LAYER OF JAM OVER WHICH HE SPREAD A THICK COATING OF HONEY. NED FIXED HIM WITH A STERN EYE. REMEMBER SIR THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DIGNITY BEFITS THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE PONY RIDERS CLUB HE SAID CHUNKY COLORED. I'D LOSE MY DIGNITY FOR A MOUTHFUL OF THAT ANY DAY HE DECIDED AFTER HAVING SAMPLED THE COMBINATION. PRESIDENT BROWN I WITHDRAW MY CRITICISM I OFFER YOU MY HUMBLE APOLOGIES. NEXT THING WE KNOW YOU'LL BE PROVIDING US WITH BEAR STEAK. BEARS DID YOU SAY DEMANDED STACY IN A VOICE NOT UNMIXED WITH AWE ARE THERE BEARS UP HERE. I RECKON THERE ARE SMILED THE GUIDE WE ARE IN THE BEAR COUNTRY NOW. I HAD A TOUGH BATTLE WITH ONE IN A CAVE NOT FAR FROM HERE SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

SHALL WE SEE ANY OF THEM ASKED TAD EAGERLY ALL YOU WANT. PERHAPS WE MAY EVEN EXPLORE SOME IF WE COME ACROSS ANY SAID THE GUIDE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FILLED THE BOYS WITH EXCITEMENT. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHEN DO WE GO HUNTING ASKED NED. THAT DEPENDS PERHAPS TUESDAY WE SHALL NEED A DOG. BUT I KNOW AN OLD SETTLER WHO WILL LEND US HIS DOG IF IT IS NOT OUT. OF COURSE DOGS CAN'T FOLLOW THE TRAIL OF AN ANIMAL AS WELL NOW AS THEY COULD WITH SNOW ON THE GROUND. BUT THIS DOG YOU WILL FIND IS A WONDER. SUPPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHAT AFTER WHICH ADMONISHING STACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BORROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNED IN FOR A SOUND SLEEP. AS YET THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY RIDING WITH THEIR PONIES OWING TO THE RUGGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOURNEYING
