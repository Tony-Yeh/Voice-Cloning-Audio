SO IN THE MORNING THEY ASKED LIGE IF HE KNEW OF A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD DO SOME STUNTS AS NED RECTOR PHRASED IT. THE GUIDE SAID THAT BY MAKING A DETOUR IN THEIR JOURNEY THAT DAY THEY WOULD CROSS TABLE LANDS SEVERAL ACRES IN EXTENT AND COVERED WITH GRASS. AND COME TO THINK OF IT THAT WILL BE AN IDEAL PLACE FOR US TO DROP OFF FOR OUR NOON MEAL HE ADDED. WE'LL LET JOSE GO ON AGAIN AND I DON'T THINK HE CAN LOSE HIMSELF SO EASILY THIS TIME. THE TRAIL IS SO PLAINLY MARKED THAT HE CAN'T MISS IT. THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS. THE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOOTED EVERY DAY AND NED SAID THAT BEFORE THE TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMIE WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A SLACK ROPE. AN EARLY START WAS MADE SO THAT THE PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE LANDS SHORTLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON. A TEMPORARY CAMP WAS QUICKLY PITCHED. AT THEIR URGENT REQUEST PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN TOLD THE BOYS TO GO AHEAD AND ENJOY THEMSELVES. BUT BE CAREFUL THAT YOU DON'T BREAK YOUR NECKS HE ADDED WITH A LAUGH. I GUESS I HAD BETTER GO ALONG TO SEE THAT YOU DO NOT. THEY ASSURED HIM THAT NOTHING WAS FURTHER FROM THEIR INTENTION AND QUICKLY CASTING ASIDE GUNS AND CARTRIDGE BELTS THEY THREW THEMSELVES INTO THEIR SADDLES AGAIN FOR A JOLLY ROMP. THE GREAT GREEN FIELD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY TALL TREES MADE THE PLACE AN IDEAL ONE FOR THEIR PURPOSE. WE'LL RACE THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD AND BACK. WE'LL DO IT THREE TIMES AND THE ONE WHO WINS TWO TIMES OUT OF THREE WILL BE IT TO THIS ALL AGREED. WALTER PERKINS WON THE HEAT THE NEXT TWO HEATS WERE DIFFERENT. THIS TIME THE BATTLE LAY BETWEEN TAD BUTLER AND NED RECTOR. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL RACE THE LITTLE INDIAN PONIES SEEMING TO ENTER THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST STRETCHING THEMSELVES OUT TO THEIR FULL LENGTHS AND WITH HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR BACKS FAIRLY FLEW ACROSS THE GREAT PLOT OF GREEN. UP TO WITHIN A MOMENT OF THE FINISH OF THE SECOND HEAT THE TWO PONIES WERE RACING NECK AND NECK. TAD HITCHED IN HIS SADDLE A LITTLE THROWING THE GREATER PART OF HIS WEIGHT ON THE STIRRUPS. HE SLAPPED TEXAS SHARPLY ON THE FLANK WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HAND. TEXAS SEEMED TO LEAP CLEAR OF THE GROUND PLANTING HIMSELF ON ALL FOURS JUST OVER THE LINE THE WINNER BY A NECK. THE THIRD HEAT WAS MERELY A REPETITION OF THE SECOND. ALL AGREED THAT TAD'S SUPERIOR HORSEMANSHIP ALONE HAD WON THE RACE FOR HIM. NED TOOK HIS DEFEAT GOOD NATUREDLY. BY THIS TIME THE BOYS HAD COME TO FEEL FULLY AS MUCH AT HOME IN THE SADDLE AS THEY FORMERLY HAD BEEN OUT OF IT. EVEN STACY BROWN THOUGH HE DID NOT SIT HIS SADDLE WITH THE SAME GRACE THAT MARKED THE RIDING OF TAD BUTLER AND NED RECTOR MORE PRACTICED HORSEMEN WAS NEVERTHELESS NO MEAN RIDER. I'LL SHOW YOU PROMISED TAD. GALLOPING INTO CAMP THE BOY FETCHED HIS SOMBRERO WHICH HE CARRIED WELL OUT INTO THE FIELD AND TOSSED AWAY. THEN BIDDING THE BOYS RIDE UP NEAR THE SPOT TO WATCH HIM HE DREW OFF SOME TEN RODS AND WHEELING SPURRED HIS PONY TO A RUN. TAD ROSE IN THE STIRRUPS AS HE NEARED THE SPOT WHERE THE HAT LAY KEEPING HIS EYES FIXED INTENTLY UPON IT. ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED TO THE SADDLE AND SLIPPED THE LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP. GRASPING THE POMMEL WITH THE LEFT HAND HE APPEARED TO DIVE HEAD FIRST TOWARD THE GROUND. THEY SAW HIS LONG HAIR ALMOST BRUSH THE GRASS ONE OF HIS HANDS SWEPT DOWN AND UP AND ONCE MORE TAD BUTLER ROSE STANDING IN HIS STIRRUPS UTTERING A COWBOY YELL AS HE WAVED THE SOMBRERO ON HIGH. THE BOYS HOWLED WITH DELIGHT THAT IS ALL DID SAVE STACY BROWN. HUH THAT'S NOTHING I CAN DO THAT MYSELF HE GRUNTED. I'VE SEEN THEM DO THAT IN THE WILD WEST SHOWS TOO MANY TIMES NOT TO KNOW HOW MYSELF. WALTER SMILED WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYES. WHY NOT SHOW US THEN HE SAID. GOT YOUR LIFE INSURED ASKED NED. IF YOU HAVEN'T I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO GO EASY. TAD IS AN EXPERIENCED RIDER. DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME NED RECTOR GUESS I KNOW HOW TO RIDE. LET ME HAVE THAT HAT TAD HE DEMANDED AS THE LATTER CAME TROTTING UP TO THE GROUP. STACY HIS FACE FLUSHED DETERMINATION PLAINLY SHOWING IN HIS EYES STRETCHED FORTH HIS HAND FOR THE SOMBRERO. RIDING BRAVELY OUT INTO THE FIELD HE TOSSED IT TO THE GROUND
