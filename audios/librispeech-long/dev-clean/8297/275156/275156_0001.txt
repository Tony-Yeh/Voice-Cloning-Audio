ADD TO THIS THAT HIS CONFIDENCE IN CATHERINE HAD BEEN RUDELY SHAKEN. HAVING ALLOWED HERSELF TO BE ENTRAPPED INTO THE DECEPTION PROPOSED BY HER MOTHER AND HAVING THUS FAR PERSEVERED IN THAT DECEPTION WERE THE CHANCES IN FAVOR OF HER REVEALING HER TRUE POSITION ESPECIALLY IF SHE WAS DISPOSED TO ENCOURAGE BENNYDECK'S SUIT. RANDAL'S LOYALTY TO CATHERINE HESITATED TO DECIDE THAT SERIOUS QUESTION AGAINST THE WOMAN WHOM HE HAD KNOWN TRUSTED AND ADMIRED FOR SO MANY YEARS. IN ANY EVENT HER SECOND MARRIAGE WOULD LEAD TO ONE DISASTROUS RESULT. IT WOULD SOONER OR LATER COME TO HERBERT'S EARS. IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD. HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SYDNEY AN INTERVIEW. TO PERFORM THAT PROMISE APPEARED TO BE NOW SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE. UNDER THE EXASPERATING INFLUENCE OF A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR WHICH SHE WAS NOT PREPARED IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHAT ACT OF IMPRUDENCE SYDNEY MIGHT NOT COMMIT. EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SYDENHAM. THAT THE CAPTAIN WOULD WELCOME HIS FRIEND'S DAUGHTER AS AFFECTIONATELY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN HIS OWN CHILD WAS NOT TO BE DOUBTED FOR A MOMENT. BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW. HE DECIDED ON HASTENING SYDNEY'S INTRODUCTION TO BENNYDECK AND ON WRITING AT ONCE TO PREPARE THE CAPTAIN FOR THAT EVENT. WOULD HE BE JUSTIFIED IN ALLUDING TO THE REPORT WHICH ASSOCIATED BENNYDECK WITH CATHERINE. CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND. IT WAS FOR THE CAPTAIN TO CONFIRM WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD SAID OF HIM IF HE THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE TO TOUCH ON THE SUBJECT IN HIS REPLY. BESIDES LOOKING TO CATHERINE'S INTEREST AND NOT FORGETTING HOW SHE HAD SUFFERED HAD RANDAL ANY RIGHT TO REGARD WITH OTHER THAN FRIENDLY FEELINGS A SECOND MARRIAGE WHICH UNITED HER TO A MAN MORALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY THE SUPERIOR OF HER FIRST HUSBAND. WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE. WRITTEN UNDER THE MODIFYING INFLUENCE OF THESE CONCLUSIONS HIS LETTER CONTAINED THE FEW WORDS THAT FOLLOW. YOUR OLD FRIEND'S DAUGHTER HAS ABANDONED HER SINFUL WAY OF LIFE AND HAS MADE SACRIFICES WHICH PROVE THE SINCERITY OF HER REPENTANCE. WITHOUT ENTERING INTO PARTICULARS WHICH MAY BE MERCIFULLY DISMISSED FROM NOTICE LET ME ONLY ASSURE YOU THAT I ANSWER FOR SYDNEY WESTERFIELD AS BEING WORTHY OF THE FATHERLY INTEREST WHICH YOU FEEL IN HER. SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW. I DON'T DOUBT THAT I AM FREE ALREADY TO DO THIS BUT IT WILL ENCOURAGE THE POOR GIRL IF I CAN SPEAK WITH YOUR AUTHORITY. HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
