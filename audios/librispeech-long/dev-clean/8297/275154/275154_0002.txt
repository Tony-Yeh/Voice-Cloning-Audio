HIS TONE TOUCHED RANDAL TO THE QUICK. I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY. SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. YES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND YOU WON'T FORGET. NO NO OF COURSE YOU WON'T FORGET. HE TRIED TO RISE AND FELL BACK AGAIN INTO HIS CHAIR. LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY. I'M NOT FIT COMPANY FOR YOU I KNOW I'LL GO WHEN YOU TELL ME. RANDAL REFUSED TO LET HIM GO AT ALL. YOU WILL STAY HERE WITH ME AND IF I HAPPEN TO BE AWAY THERE WILL BE SOMEBODY IN THE HOUSE WHO IS ALMOST AS FOND OF YOU AS I AM. HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAKUP OF THE FAMILY. AND NOW REST HE SAID AND LET ME PUT THIS CUSHION UNDER YOUR HEAD
