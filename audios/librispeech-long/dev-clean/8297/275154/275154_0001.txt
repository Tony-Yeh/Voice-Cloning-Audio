IN A MAN MORALLY WEAK CALAMITY SUFFERED WITHOUT RESISTING POWER BREAKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE SURFACE WHICH EXHIBITS A GENTLEMAN AND SHOWS THE NAKED NATURE WHICH CLAIMS KINDRED WITH OUR ANCESTOR THE SAVAGE. HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION. RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SYDNEY IS. RANDAL ADMITTED IT. GIVE ME HER ADDRESS. NO HERBERT. YOU WON'T WRITE IT AND YOU WON'T GIVE IT. I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER. GO BACK TO YOUR CHAIR FIERCE LOOKS AND CLINCHED FISTS DON'T FRIGHTEN ME. MISS WESTERFIELD IS QUITE RIGHT IN SEPARATING HERSELF FROM YOU. AND YOU ARE QUITE WRONG IN WISHING TO GO BACK TO HER. THERE ARE MY REASONS TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEM. AND ONCE AGAIN SIT DOWN. HE SPOKE STERNLY WITH HIS HEART ACHING FOR HIS BROTHER ALL THE TIME HE WAS RIGHT. THE ONE WAY IS THE POSITIVE WAY WHEN A MAN WHO SUFFERS TROUBLE IS DEGRADED BY IT. THE POOR WRETCH SANK UNDER RANDAL'S FIRM VOICE AND STEADY EYE. DON'T BE HARD ON ME HE SAID. I THINK A MAN IN MY SITUATION IS TO BE PITIED ESPECIALLY BY HIS BROTHER. I'M NOT LIKE YOU I'M NOT ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE ALONE. I'VE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING A KIND WOMAN TO TALK TO ME AND TAKE CARE OF ME. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK. I HAVEN'T GOT MY WIFE SHE HAS THROWN ME OVER AND TAKEN MY CHILD AWAY FROM ME. AND NOW SYDNEY'S TAKEN AWAY FROM ME NEXT. I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE. GIVE ME BACK SYDNEY OR KNOCK OUT MY BRAINS. I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF. OH WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS. I WAS SO HAPPY RANDAL WITH CATHERINE AND LITTLE KITTY. HE LAID HIS HEAD WEARILY ON THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR. RANDAL OFFERED HIM MORE WINE HE REFUSED IT. I'M AFRAID HE SAID. WINE MADDENS ME IF I TAKE TOO MUCH OF IT. I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW. NO I'M NOT FAINT. IT EASES MY HEAD WHEN I REST LIKE THIS. SHAKE HANDS RANDAL WE HAVE NEVER HAD ANY UNFRIENDLY WORDS WE MUSTN'T BEGIN NOW. THERE'S SOMETHING PERVERSE ABOUT ME. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW FOND I WAS OF SYDNEY TILL I LOST HER I DIDN'T KNOW HOW FOND I WAS OF MY WIFE TILL I LEFT HER. HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD. WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT. HE ASTONISHED HIS BROTHER BY A NEW ENTREATY THE LAST IMAGINABLE ENTREATY THAT RANDAL EXPECTED TO HEAR. DEAR OLD FELLOW I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR. TELL ME WHERE MY WIFE IS LIVING NOW. SURELY RANDAL ANSWERED YOU KNOW THAT SHE IS NO LONGER YOUR WIFE. NEVER MIND THAT I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO HER. YOU CAN'T DO IT. WILL YOU GIVE HER A MESSAGE. LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS FIRST. HERBERT LIFTED HIS HEAD AND LAID HIS HAND EARNESTLY ON HIS BROTHER'S ARM. WHEN HE SAID HIS NEXT WORDS HE WAS ALMOST LIKE HIS OLD SELF AGAIN
