NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SYDNEY'S INTERESTS TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB. NOTHING WAS KNOWN OF THE CAPTAIN'S MOVEMENTS THERE. ON THE CHANCE OF GETTING THE INFORMATION THAT HE WANTED RANDAL WROTE TO THE HOTEL AT SANDYSEAL. THE LANDLORD'S REPLY A LITTLE SURPRISED HIM. SOME DAYS SINCE THE YACHT HAD AGAIN APPEARED IN THE BAY. CAPTAIN BENNYDECK HAD LANDED TO ALL APPEARANCE IN FAIRLY GOOD HEALTH AND HAD LEFT BY AN EARLY TRAIN FOR LONDON. THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER. THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDAL. HE CALLED AT HIS FRIEND'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE ONLY TO HEAR FROM THE SERVANTS THAT THEY HAD SEEN NOTHING OF THEIR MASTER. RANDAL WAITED A WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT. DURING THIS INTERVAL HIS PATIENCE WAS REWARDED IN AN UNEXPECTED MANNER. HE DISCOVERED THE CAPTAIN'S ADDRESS BY MEANS OF A LETTER FROM CATHERINE DATED BUCK'S HOTEL SYDENHAM. HAVING GENTLY REPROACHED HIM FOR NOT WRITING TO HER OR CALLING ON HER SHE INVITED HIM TO DINNER AT THE HOTEL. HER LETTER CONCLUDED IN THESE WORDS YOU WILL ONLY MEET ONE PERSON BESIDES OURSELVES YOUR FRIEND AND SINCE WE LAST MET OUR FRIEND TOO. CAPTAIN BENNYDECK HAS GOT TIRED OF THE SEA. HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SYDENHAM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM. THESE LINES SET RANDAL THINKING SERIOUSLY. IN SPITE OF THE APPEARANCE OF INNOCENCE WHICH PERVADED CATHERINE'S LETTER THE TRUE MOTIVE FOR BREAKING OFF HIS CRUISE MIGHT BE FOUND AS RANDAL CONCLUDED IN CATHERINE HERSELF. HER RESIDENCE AT THE SEA SIDE HELPED BY THE LAPSE OF TIME HAD RESTORED TO HER PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS ALMOST ALL THEY HAD LOST UNDER THE DETERIORATING INFLUENCES OF CARE AND GRIEF AND HER CHANGE OF NAME MUST HAVE PROTECTED HER FROM A DISCOVERY OF THE DIVORCE WHICH WOULD HAVE SHOCKED A MAN SO SINCERELY RELIGIOUS AS BENNYDECK. HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM. WAS SHE AWARE OF THE INTEREST THAT HE FELT IN HER. AND WAS IT SECRETLY UNDERSTOOD AND RETURNED. RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW. IN THE SHORT TIME THAT PASSED BEFORE THE DAY OF THE DINNER DISTRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES STRENGTHENED HIS RESOLUTION. AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT. HE COULD ONLY POINT TO A SEAT. HERBERT DROPPED INTO THE CHAIR AS IF HE WAS REDUCED TO THE LAST EXTREMITY OF FATIGUE. AND YET HE SPOKE ROUGHLY HE LOOKED LIKE AN ANGRY MAN BROUGHT TO BAY. I SEEM TO FRIGHTEN YOU HE SAID. YOU DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY. GIVE ME A GLASS OF WINE I'VE BEEN WALKING I DON'T KNOW WHERE. A LONG DISTANCE I'M DEAD BEAT. HE DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY. WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
