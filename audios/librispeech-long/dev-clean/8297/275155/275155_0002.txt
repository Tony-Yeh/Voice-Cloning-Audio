THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENSE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS. SAY THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF THE COURSE FORCED UPON ME AND MY DAUGHTER BY YOUR BROTHER'S INFAMOUS CONDUCT AND YOU WILL BE NEARER THE MARK. RANDAL PASSED THIS OVER WITHOUT NOTICE. BE SO GOOD HE SAID AS TO TELL CATHERINE THAT I TRY TO MAKE EVERY POSSIBLE ALLOWANCE FOR HER BUT THAT I CANNOT CONSENT TO SIT AT HER DINNER TABLE AND THAT I DARE NOT FACE MY POOR LITTLE NIECE AFTER WHAT I HAVE HEARD. MISSUS PRESTY RECOVERED ALL HER AUDACITY. A VERY WISE DECISION SHE REMARKED. YOUR SOUR FACE WOULD SPOIL THE BEST DINNER THAT EVER WAS PUT ON THE TABLE. HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BENNYDECK. RANDAL ASKED IF HIS FRIEND WAS THEN AT THE HOTEL. MISSUS PRESTY SMILED SIGNIFICANTLY. NOT AT THE HOTEL JUST NOW. WHERE IS HE. WHERE HE IS EVERY DAY ABOUT THIS TIME OUT DRIVING WITH CATHERINE AND KITTY. IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND. HE TOOK LEAVE OF MISSUS PRESTY WITH THE FORMALITY DUE TO A STRANGER HE MERELY BOWED. THAT INCORRIGIBLE OLD WOMAN TREATED HIM WITH AFFECTIONATE FAMILIARITY IN RETURN. GOOD BY DEAR RANDAL. ONE MOMENT BEFORE YOU GO. WILL IT BE OF ANY USE IF WE INVITE YOU TO THE MARRIAGE. ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN. WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN. HE STOOD LOOKING ABSENTLY AT THE PASSENGERS LEAVING THE CARRIAGE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE PLATFORM
