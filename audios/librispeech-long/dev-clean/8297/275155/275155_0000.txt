ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SYDENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER. HIS PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS IN PLEADING FOR A FAVORABLE RECEPTION OF HIS BROTHER'S MESSAGE WERE SO UNCERTAIN THAT HE REFRAINED IN FEAR OF RAISING HOPES WHICH HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY FROM TAKING HERBERT INTO HIS CONFIDENCE. NO ONE KNEW ON WHAT ERRAND HE WAS BENT WHEN HE LEFT THE HOUSE. AS HE TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE CARRIAGE THE NEWSPAPER BOY APPEARED AT THE WINDOW AS USUAL. THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL BOUGHT IT. AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE. HE READ THE PARAGRAPH IN WHICH IT APPEARED. THE CHARMING WIDOW MISSUS NORMAN IS WE HEAR AMONG THE DISTINGUISHED GUESTS STAYING AT BUCK'S HOTEL. IT IS WHISPERED THAT THE LADY IS TO BE SHORTLY UNITED TO A RETIRED NAVAL OFFICER OF ARCTIC FAME NOW BETTER KNOWN PERHAPS AS ONE OF OUR LEADING PHILANTHROPISTS. THE ALLUSION TO BENNYDECK WAS TOO PLAIN TO BE MISTAKEN. RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH. THE CHARMING WIDOW. WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS LAST WORD REFERRED TO CATHERINE. TO SUPPOSE HER CAPABLE OF ASSUMING TO BE A WIDOW AND IF THE CHILD ASKED QUESTIONS OF TELLING KITTY THAT HER FATHER WAS DEAD WAS IN RANDAL'S ESTIMATION TO WRONG HER CRUELLY. WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER. MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER. MISSUS PRESTY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL. RANDAL FOUND HER COMFORTABLY ESTABLISHED IN A SUMMERHOUSE WITH HER KNITTING IN HER HANDS AND A NEWSPAPER ON HER LAP. SHE ADVANCED TO MEET HIM ALL SMILES AND AMIABILITY. HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE BEGAN. HER KEEN PENETRATION DISCOVERED SOMETHING IN HIS FACE WHICH CHECKED THE GAYETY OF HER WELCOME. YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SPOIL OUR PLEASANT LITTLE DINNER BY BRINGING BAD NEWS. SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY. IT DEPENDS ON YOU TO DECIDE THAT RANDAL REPLIED. HOW VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO A POOR USELESS OLD WOMAN. DON'T BE MYSTERIOUS MY DEAR. I DON'T BELONG TO THE GENERATION WHICH RAISES STORMS IN TEA CUPS AND CALLS SKIRMISHES WITH SAVAGES BATTLES OUT WITH IT. RANDAL HANDED HIS PAPER TO HER OPEN AT THE RIGHT PLACE. THERE IS MY NEWS HE SAID. I AM INDEED SORRY TO SPOIL YOUR DRAMATIC EFFECT SHE SAID. BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SYDENHAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS. THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND. BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER A REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS. BESIDES IF IT ISN'T TRUE NOW IT WILL BE TRUE NEXT WEEK. THE AUTHOR ONLY SAYS IT'S WHISPERED. HOW DELICATE OF HIM. WHAT A PERFECT GENTLEMAN. YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATHERINE IS A WIDOW. I SAY IT WITH PRIDE A WIDOW OF MY MAKING. RANDAL DREW BACK A STEP
