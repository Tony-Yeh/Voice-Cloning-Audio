MISSUS PRESTY'S AUDACITY WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN HE COULD UNDERSTAND. IS THIS WOMAN MAD HE SAID TO HIMSELF. SIT DOWN SAID MISSUS PRESTY. IF YOU ARE DETERMINED TO MAKE A SERIOUS BUSINESS OF IT IF YOU INSIST ON MY JUSTIFYING MYSELF YOU ARE TO BE PITIED FOR NOT POSSESSING A SENSE OF HUMOR BUT YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY. I AM PUT ON MY DEFENSE VERY WELL. YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSEAL AFTER YOU LEFT US. HAVING RELATED THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE SUGGESTED THAT RANDAL SHOULD PUT HIMSELF IN CATHERINE'S PLACE BEFORE HE VENTURED ON EXPRESSING AN OPINION. WOULD YOU HAVE EXPOSED YOURSELF TO BE HUMILIATED AGAIN IN THE SAME WAY SHE ASKED. AND WOULD YOU HAVE SEEN YOUR CHILD MADE TO SUFFER AS WELL AS YOURSELF. I SHOULD HAVE KEPT IN RETIREMENT FOR THE FUTURE HE ANSWERED AND NOT HAVE TRUSTED MY CHILD AND MYSELF AMONG STRANGERS IN HOTELS AH INDEED. YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER. I WONDER WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE WHEN CAPTAIN BENNYDECK PAID US A VISIT AT THE SEASIDE. HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM. WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE. IF HE HAD ASKED YOU ABOUT MISTER NORMAN HOW WOULD YOU HAVE ANSWERED HIM. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH. YOU WOULD HAVE SAID THERE WAS NO MISTER NORMAN. YES. EXACTLY WHAT I DID. AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW. IF I HAD TOLD THE TRUTH AT THIS HOTEL WHEN EVERYBODY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT MISSUS NORMAN THAT HANDSOME LADY WAS WHAT WOULD THE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN TO CATHERINE AND HER LITTLE GIRL. NO NO. I HAVE MADE THE BEST OF A MISERABLE SITUATION I HAVE CONSULTED THE TRANQUILLITY OF A CRUELLY INJURED WOMAN AND AN INNOCENT CHILD WITH THIS INEVITABLE RESULT I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO TREAT YOUR BROTHER LIKE A CHARACTER IN A NOVEL. I HAVE SHIP WRECKED HERBERT AS THE SHORTEST WAY OF ANSWERING INCONVENIENT QUESTIONS. VESSEL FOUND BOTTOM UPWARD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC AND EVERYBODY ON BOARD DROWNED OF COURSE. WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED. RANDAL DECIDED ON LEAVING HER. HAVE YOU DONE ALL THIS WITH CATHERINE'S CONSENT HE ASKED AS HE GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR. CATHERINE SUBMITS TO CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE A SENSIBLE WOMAN. DOES SHE SUBMIT TO YOUR TELLING KITTY THAT HER FATHER IS DEAD. FOR THE FIRST TIME MISSUS PRESTY BECAME SERIOUS. WAIT A MINUTE SHE ANSWERED. BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER. I SAID WILL YOU LET KITTY SEE HER FATHER AGAIN. AND HOW DID CATHERINE ANSWER YOU HE INQUIRED. HONESTLY. SHE SAID I DAREN'T. AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN. SHE ASKED DIRECTLY IF HER FATHER WAS DEAD
