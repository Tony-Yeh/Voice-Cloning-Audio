SLIGHT RAINSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP ROUND THE MOUNTAIN BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATCHED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF. THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMY FRAGRANCE AND THE BURST OF BIRD SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPARRAL. THE NIGHTS TOO ARE DELIGHTFUL WATCHING WITH SHASTA BENEATH THE GREAT STARRY DOME. A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES ARE HEARD BUT SO FINELY BLENDED THEY SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKE A DEEPER SILENCE. AND HOW GRANDLY DO THE GREAT LOGS AND BRANCHES OF YOUR CAMPFIRE GIVE FORTH THE HEAT AND LIGHT THAT DURING THEIR LONG CENTURY LIVES THEY HAVE SO SLOWLY GATHERED FROM THE SUN STORING IT AWAY IN BEAUTIFUL DOTTED CELLS AND BEADS OF AMBER GUM. THE NEIGHBORING TREES LOOK INTO THE CHARMED CIRCLE AS IF THE NOON OF ANOTHER DAY HAD COME FAMILIAR FLOWERS AND GRASSES THAT CHANCE TO BE NEAR SEEM FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL AND IMPRESSIVE THAN BY DAY AND AS THE DEAD TREES GIVE FORTH THEIR LIGHT ALL THE OTHER RICHES OF THEIR LIVES SEEM TO BE SET FREE AND WITH THE REJOICING FLAMES RISE AGAIN TO THE SKY. IN SETTING OUT FROM STRAWBERRY VALLEY BY BEARING OFF TO THE NORTHWESTWARD A FEW MILES YOU MAY SEE. THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE CHARMING LINNAEA IS FOUND THOUGH IT IS COMMON TO THE NORTHWARD THROUGH OREGON AND WASHINGTON. HERE TOO YOU MAY FIND THE CURIOUS BUT UNLOVABLE DARLINGTONIA A CARNIVOROUS PLANT THAT DEVOURS BUMBLEBEES GRASSHOPPERS ANTS MOTHS AND OTHER INSECTS WITH INSATIABLE APPETITE. IN APPROACHING IT ITS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING YELLOW SPOTTED HOOD AND WATCHFUL ATTITUDE WILL BE LIKELY TO MAKE YOU GO CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE BOG WHERE IT STANDS AS IF YOU WERE APPROACHING A DANGEROUS SNAKE. IT ALSO OCCURS IN A BOG NEAR SOTHERN'S STATION ON THE STAGE ROAD WHERE I FIRST SAW IT AND IN OTHER SIMILAR BOGS THROUGHOUT THE MOUNTAINS HEREABOUTS. THE BIG SPRING OF THE SACRAMENTO IS ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF ABOVE SISSON'S ISSUING FROM THE BASE OF A DRIFT COVERED HILL. IT IS LINED WITH EMERALD ALGAE AND MOSSES AND SHADED WITH ALDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSHES WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING. ITS WATERS APPARENTLY UNAFFECTED BY FLOOD OR DROUTH HEAT OR COLD FALL AT ONCE INTO WHITE RAPIDS WITH A RUSH AND DASH AS IF GLAD TO ESCAPE FROM THE DARKNESS TO BEGIN THEIR WILD COURSE DOWN THE CANYON TO THE PLAIN. MUIR'S PEAK A FEW MILES TO THE NORTH OF THE SPRING RISES ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE PLAIN ON WHICH IT STANDS AND IS EASILY CLIMBED. THE VIEW IS VERY FINE AND WELL REPAYS THE SLIGHT WALK TO ITS SUMMIT FROM WHICH MUCH OF YOUR WAY ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN MAY BE STUDIED AND CHOSEN. THE VIEW OBTAINED OF THE WHITNEY GLACIER SHOULD TEMPT YOU TO VISIT IT SINCE IT IS THE LARGEST OF THE SHASTA GLACIERS AND ITS LOWER PORTION ABOUNDS IN BEAUTIFUL AND INTERESTING CASCADES AND CREVASSES. IT IS THREE OR FOUR MILES LONG AND TERMINATES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN MORAINE SPRINKLED ICE CLIFFS SIXTY FEET HIGH. THE LONG GRAY SLOPES LEADING UP TO THE GLACIER SEEM REMARKABLY SMOOTH AND UNBROKEN. THEY ARE MUCH INTERRUPTED NEVERTHELESS WITH ABRUPT JAGGED PRECIPITOUS GORGES WHICH THOUGH OFFERING INSTRUCTIVE SECTIONS OF THE LAVAS FOR EXAMINATION WOULD BETTER BE SHUNNED BY MOST PEOPLE. THIS MAY BE DONE BY KEEPING WELL DOWN ON THE BASE UNTIL FRONTING THE GLACIER BEFORE BEGINNING THE ASCENT
