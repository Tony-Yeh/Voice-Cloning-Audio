THE VAN BREMER BROTHERS AFTER WHOM THE MOUNTAIN IS NAMED TOLD ME THAT THEY ONCE CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN WITH THEIR RIFLES AND HOUNDS ON A GRAND HUNT BUT AFTER KEEPING UP THE PURSUIT FOR A WEEK THEIR BOOTS AND CLOTHING GAVE WAY AND THE HOUNDS WERE LAMED AND WORN OUT WITHOUT HAVING RUN DOWN A SINGLE SHEEP NOTWITHSTANDING THEY RAN NIGHT AND DAY. ON SMOOTH SPOTS LEVEL OR ASCENDING THE HOUNDS GAINED ON THE SHEEP BUT ON DESCENDING GROUND AND OVER ROUGH MASSES OF ANGULAR ROCKS THEY FELL HOPELESSLY BEHIND. ONLY HALF A DOZEN SHEEP WERE SHOT AS THEY PASSED THE HUNTERS STATIONED NEAR THEIR PATHS CIRCLING ROUND THE RUGGED SUMMIT. THE FULL GROWN BUCKS WEIGH NEARLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS. THE MULE DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY. THEIR LONG MASSIVE EARS GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE. ONE LARGE BUCK THAT I MEASURED STOOD THREE FEET AND SEVEN INCHES HIGH AT THE SHOULDERS AND WHEN THE EARS WERE EXTENDED HORIZONTALLY THE DISTANCE ACROSS FROM TIP TO TIP WAS TWO FEET AND ONE INCH. HERE YOU ARE LOOKING SOUTHEASTWARD AND THE MODOC LANDSCAPE WHICH AT ONCE TAKES POSSESSION OF YOU LIES REVEALED IN FRONT. WHEN I FIRST STOOD THERE ONE BRIGHT DAY BEFORE SUNDOWN THE LAKE WAS FAIRLY BLOOMING IN PURPLE LIGHT AND WAS SO RESPONSIVE TO THE SKY IN BOTH CALMNESS AND COLOR IT SEEMED ITSELF A SKY. NO MOUNTAIN SHORE HIDES ITS LOVELINESS. THE FOREST ALSO WAS FLOODED WITH SUN PURPLE NOT A SPIRE MOVING AND MOUNT SHASTA WAS SEEN TOWERING ABOVE IT REJOICING IN THE INEFFABLE BEAUTY OF THE ALPENGLOW. BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE EYE. THAT DARK MYSTERIOUS LAVA PLAIN BETWEEN THEM COMPELLED ATTENTION. HERE YOU TRACE YAWNING FISSURES THERE CLUSTERS OF SOMBER PITS NOW YOU MARK WHERE THE LAVA IS BENT AND CORRUGATED IN SWELLING RIDGES AND DOMES AGAIN WHERE IT BREAKS INTO A ROUGH MASS OF LOOSE BLOCKS. TUFTS OF GRASS GROW FAR APART HERE AND THERE AND SMALL BUSHES OF HARDY SAGE BUT THEY HAVE A SINGED APPEARANCE AND CAN DO LITTLE TO HIDE THE BLACKNESS. THEN FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS. THEN DARKNESS LIKE DEATH. NEXT MORNING THE CRISP SUNSHINY AIR MADE EVEN THE MODOC LANDSCAPE LESS HOPELESS AND WE VENTURED DOWN THE BLUFF TO THE EDGE OF THE LAVA BEDS. JUST AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF WE CAME TO A SQUARE ENCLOSED BY A STONE WALL. THIS IS A GRAVEYARD WHERE LIE BURIED THIRTY SOLDIERS MOST OF WHOM MET THEIR FATE OUT IN THE LAVA BEDS AS WE LEARN BY THE BOARDS MARKING THE GRAVES A GLOOMY PLACE TO DIE IN AND DEADLY LOOKING EVEN WITHOUT MODOCS. THE POOR FELLOWS THAT LIE HERE DESERVE FAR MORE PITY THAN THEY HAVE EVER RECEIVED. THIS IS WHERE GENERAL CANBY WAS SLAIN WHILE SEEKING TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE TREACHEROUS MODOCS. TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK. YOSEMITE WAS NOT HELD FOR A SINGLE DAY AGAINST THE PURSUING TROOPS BUT THE MODOCS HELD THEIR FORT FOR MONTHS UNTIL WEARY OF BEING HEMMED IN THEY CHOSE TO WITHDRAW. IT CONSISTS OF NUMEROUS REDOUBTS FORMED BY THE UNEQUAL SUBSIDENCE OF PORTIONS OF THE LAVA FLOW AND A COMPLICATED NETWORK OF REDANS ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED WITH SALIENT AND RE ENTERING ANGLES BEING UNITED EACH TO THE OTHER AND TO THE REDOUBTS BY A LABYRINTH OF OPEN AND COVERED CORRIDORS SOME OF WHICH EXPAND AT INTERVALS INTO SPACIOUS CAVERNS FORMING AS A WHOLE THE MOST COMPLETE NATURAL GIBRALTAR I EVER SAW
