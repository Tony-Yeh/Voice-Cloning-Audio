SHASTA RAMBLES AND MODOC MEMORIES. ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ALL MAY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLIMBERS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS. THE DISTANCE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES AND WILL TAKE SOME OF THE TIME WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO BUT THE BENEFITS WILL COMPENSATE FOR ANY NUMBER OF WEEKS. PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERY BODY SHOULD BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF. TAKE A COURSE OF GOOD WATER AND AIR AND IN THE ETERNAL YOUTH OF NATURE YOU MAY RENEW YOUR OWN. GO QUIETLY ALONE NO HARM WILL BEFALL YOU. SOME HAVE STRANGE MORBID FEARS AS SOON AS THEY FIND THEMSELVES WITH NATURE EVEN IN THE KINDEST AND WILDEST OF HER SOLITUDES LIKE VERY SICK CHILDREN AFRAID OF THEIR MOTHER AS IF GOD WERE DEAD AND THE DEVIL WERE KING. BUT IT IS FAR BETTER TO GO AFOOT. THEN YOU ARE FREE TO MAKE WIDE WAVERINGS AND ZIGZAGS AWAY FROM THE ROADS TO VISIT THE GREAT FOUNTAIN STREAMS OF THE RIVERS THE GLACIERS ALSO AND THE WILDEST RETREATS IN THE PRIMEVAL FORESTS WHERE THE BEST PLANTS AND ANIMALS DWELL AND WHERE MANY A FLOWER BELL WILL RING AGAINST YOUR KNEES AND FRIENDLY TREES WILL REACH OUT THEIR FRONDED BRANCHES AND TOUCH YOU AS YOU PASS. ONE BLANKET WILL BE ENOUGH TO CARRY OR YOU MAY FOREGO THE PLEASURE AND BURDEN ALTOGETHER AS WOOD FOR FIRES IS EVERYWHERE ABUNDANT. ONLY A LITTLE FOOD WILL BE REQUIRED. BERRIES AND PLUMS ABOUND IN SEASON AND QUAIL AND GROUSE AND DEER THE MAGNIFICENT SHAGGY MULE DEER AS WELL AS THE COMMON SPECIES. AS YOU SWEEP AROUND SO GRAND A CENTER THE MOUNTAIN ITSELF SEEMS TO TURN DISPLAYING ITS RICHES LIKE THE REVOLVING PYRAMIDS IN JEWELERS WINDOWS. THE PLAY OF COLORS FROM THE FIRST TOUCHES OF THE MORNING SUN ON THE SUMMIT DOWN THE SNOWFIELDS AND THE ICE AND LAVA UNTIL THE FORESTS ARE AGLOW IS A NEVER ENDING DELIGHT THE ROSY LAVA AND THE FINE FLUSHINGS OF THE SNOW BEING INEFFABLY LOVELY. THUS ONE SAUNTERS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF TIME. YET STRANGE TO SAY THERE ARE DAYS EVEN HERE SOMEWHAT DULL LOOKING WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS UNCOMMUNICATIVE SENDING OUT NO APPRECIABLE INVITATION AS IF NOT AT HOME. AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AS IF CROUCHING AND WEARY IT WERE TAKING REST. BUT SHASTA IS ALWAYS AT HOME TO THOSE WHO LOVE HER AND IS EVER IN A THRILL OF ENTHUSIASTIC ACTIVITY BURNING FIRES WITHIN GRINDING GLACIERS WITHOUT AND FOUNTAINS EVER FLOWING. EVERY CRYSTAL DANCES RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCHES OF THE SUN AND CURRENTS OF SAP IN THE GROWING CELLS OF ALL THE VEGETATION ARE EVER IN A VITAL WHIRL AND RUSH AND THOUGH MANY FEET AND WINGS ARE FOLDED HOW MANY ARE ASTIR. AND THE WANDERING WINDS HOW BUSY THEY ARE AND WHAT A BREADTH OF SOUND AND MOTION THEY MAKE GLINTING AND BUBBLING ABOUT THE CRAGS OF THE SUMMIT SIFTING THROUGH THE WOODS FEELING THEIR WAY FROM GROVE TO GROVE RUFFLING THE LOOSE HAIR ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE BEARS FANNING AND ROCKING YOUNG BIRDS IN THEIR CRADLES MAKING A TRUMPET OF EVERY COROLLA AND CARRYING THEIR FRAGRANCE AROUND THE WORLD
