TRACING THE MC CLOUD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS AMONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVER AND DOWN THROUGH FORESTS OF SUGAR PINE TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAUNTER AND IMPOSES NO HARDSHIP. FOOD MAY BE HAD AT MODERATE INTERVALS AND THE WHOLE CIRCUIT FORMS ONE EVER DEEPENING BROADENING STREAM OF ENJOYMENT. FALL RIVER IS A VERY REMARKABLE STREAM. IT IS ONLY ABOUT TEN MILES LONG AND IS COMPOSED OF SPRINGS RAPIDS AND FALLS SPRINGS BEAUTIFULLY SHADED AT ONE END OF IT A SHOWY FALL ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FEET HIGH AT THE OTHER AND A RUSH OF CRYSTAL RAPIDS BETWEEN. NOWHERE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF CALIFORNIA ARE THE FORESTS OF YELLOW PINE SO EXTENSIVE AND EXCLUSIVE AS ON THE HEADWATERS OF THE PITT. THEY COVER THE MOUNTAINS AND ALL THE LOWER SLOPES THAT BORDER THE WIDE OPEN VALLEYS WHICH ABOUND THERE PRESSING FORWARD IN IMPOSING RANKS SEEMINGLY THE HARDIEST AND MOST FIRMLY ESTABLISHED OF ALL THE NORTHERN CONIFERAE. THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE I HAVE ALREADY IN PART DESCRIBED. MILES OF ITS FLANKS ARE DOTTED WITH HOT SPRINGS MANY OF THEM SO SULPHUROUS AND BOISTEROUS AND NOISY IN THEIR BOILING THAT THEY SEEM INCLINED TO BECOME GEYSERS LIKE THOSE OF THE YELLOWSTONE. THE ASCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE IS AN EASY WALK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT ARE EXTREMELY TELLING. THE LOFTY ICY SHASTA TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL SEEMS BUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM YOU THOUGH THE DISTANCE IN AN AIR LINE IS ABOUT SIXTY MILES. THE BIG MEADOWS LIE NEAR THE FOOT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS BASIN SET IN THE HEART OF THE RICHLY FORESTED MOUNTAINS SCARCELY SURPASSED IN THE GRANDEUR OF ITS SURROUNDINGS BY TAHOE. DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD IT WAS A MER DE GLACE THEN A LAKE AND NOW A LEVEL MEADOW SHINING WITH BOUNTIFUL SPRINGS AND STREAMS. IN THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF ITS BIG SPRING FOUNTAINS IT EXCELS EVEN SHASTA. ONE OF THE LARGEST THAT I MEASURED FORMS A LAKELET NEARLY A HUNDRED YARDS IN DIAMETER AND IN THE GENEROUS FLOOD IT SENDS FORTH OFFERS ONE OF THE MOST TELLING SYMBOLS OF NATURE'S AFFLUENCE TO BE FOUND IN THE MOUNTAINS. THE GREAT WILDS OF OUR COUNTRY ONCE HELD TO BE BOUNDLESS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE ARE BEING RAPIDLY INVADED AND OVERRUN IN EVERY DIRECTION AND EVERYTHING DESTRUCTIBLE IN THEM IS BEING DESTROYED. HOW FAR DESTRUCTION MAY GO IT IS NOT EASY TO GUESS. EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED AND HARRIED. EVEN THE SKY IS NOT SAFE FROM SCATH BLURRED AND BLACKENED WHOLE SUMMERS TOGETHER WITH THE SMOKE OF FIRES THAT DEVOUR THE WOODS. THE SHASTA REGION IS STILL A FRESH UNSPOILED WILDERNESS ACCESSIBLE AND AVAILABLE FOR TRAVELERS OF EVERY KIND AND DEGREE. WOULD IT NOT THEN BE A FINE THING TO SET IT APART LIKE THE YELLOWSTONE AND YOSEMITE AS A NATIONAL PARK FOR THE WELFARE AND BENEFIT OF ALL MANKIND PRESERVING ITS FOUNTAINS AND FORESTS AND ALL ITS GLAD LIFE IN PRIMEVAL BEAUTY. VERY LITTLE OF THE REGION CAN EVER BE MORE VALUABLE FOR ANY OTHER USE CERTAINLY NOT FOR GOLD NOR FOR GRAIN
