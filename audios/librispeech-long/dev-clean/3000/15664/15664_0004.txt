OTHER CASTLES SCARCELY LESS STRONG ARE CONNECTED WITH THIS BY SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES KNOWN ONLY TO THE INDIANS WHILE THE UNNATURAL BLACKNESS OF THE ROCK OUT OF WHICH NATURE HAS CONSTRUCTED THESE DEFENSES AND THE WEIRD INHUMAN PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE WHOLE REGION ARE WELL CALCULATED TO INSPIRE TERROR. DEADLY WAS THE TASK OF STORMING SUCH A PLACE. THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH BYWAYS BOTH OVER AND UNDER GROUND AND COULD AT ANY TIME SINK SUDDENLY OUT OF SIGHT LIKE SQUIRRELS AMONG THE LOOSE BOULDERS. TO JUDGE FROM THE FEW I HAVE SEEN MODOCS ARE NOT VERY AMIABLE LOOKING PEOPLE AT BEST. CAPTAIN JACK'S CAVE IS ONE OF THE MANY SOMBER CELLS OF THE CASTLE. IT MEASURES TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY FEET IN DIAMETER AT THE ENTRANCE AND EXTENDS BUT A SHORT DISTANCE IN A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION. THE FLOOR IS LITTERED WITH THE BONES OF THE ANIMALS SLAUGHTERED FOR FOOD DURING THE WAR. SOME EAGER ARCHAEOLOGIST MAY HEREAFTER DISCOVER THIS CABIN AND STARTLE HIS WORLD BY ANNOUNCING ANOTHER OF THE STONE AGE CAVES. THE SUN SHINES FREELY INTO ITS MOUTH AND GRACEFUL BUNCHES OF GRASS AND ERIOGONUMS AND SAGE GROW ABOUT IT DOING WHAT THEY CAN TOWARD ITS REDEMPTION FROM DEGRADING ASSOCIATIONS AND MAKING IT BEAUTIFUL. WHERE THE LAVA MEETS THE LAKE THERE ARE SOME FINE CURVING BAYS BEAUTIFULLY EMBROIDERED WITH RUSHES AND POLYGONUMS A FAVORITE RESORT OF WATERFOWL. ON OUR RETURN KEEPING CLOSE ALONG SHORE WE CAUSED A NOISY PLASHING AND BEATING OF WINGS AMONG CRANES AND GEESE. THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE. THE COUNTENANCE OF THE LAVA BEDS BECAME LESS AND LESS FORBIDDING. TUFTS OF PALE GRASSES RELIEVED ON THE JET ROCKS LOOKED LIKE ORNAMENTS ON A MANTEL THICK FURRED MATS OF EMERALD MOSSES APPEARED IN DAMP SPOTS NEXT THE SHORE AND I NOTICED ONE TUFT OF SMALL FERNS. FROM YEAR TO YEAR IN THE KINDLY WEATHER THE BEDS ARE THUS GATHERING BEAUTY BEAUTY FOR ASHES. RETURNING TO SHEEP ROCK AND FOLLOWING THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD ONE IS SOON BACK AGAIN BENEATH THE SNOWS AND SHADOWS OF SHASTA AND THE ASH CREEK AND MC CLOUD GLACIERS COME INTO VIEW ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSED CLOUDLIKE MASSES OF DOWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING IN SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVERLIKE GO WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA. THESE WITH A FEW OTHERS AS YET NAMELESS ARE LINGERING REMNANTS OF ONCE GREAT GLACIERS THAT OCCUPIED THE CANYONS NOW TAKEN BY THE RIVERS AND IN A FEW CENTURIES WILL UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS VANISH ALTOGETHER. THEY SELDOM SINK OUT OF SIGHT SAVE HERE AND THERE IN THE MORAINES OR GLACIERS OR EARLY IN THE SEASON BENEATH THE BANKS AND BRIDGES OF SNOW SOON TO ISSUE AGAIN. BUT IN THE NORTH HALF LADEN WITH RENT AND POROUS LAVA SMALL TRIBUTARY STREAMS ARE RARE AND THE RIVERS FLOWING FOR A TIME BENEATH THE SKY OF ROCK AT LENGTH BURST FORTH INTO THE LIGHT IN GENEROUS VOLUME FROM SEAMS AND CAVERNS FILTERED COOL AND SPARKLING AS IF THEIR BONDAGE IN DARKNESS SAFE FROM THE VICISSITUDES OF THE WEATHER IN THEIR YOUTH WERE ONLY A BLESSING. ONLY A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE WATER DERIVED FROM THE MELTING ICE AND SNOW OF SHASTA FLOWS DOWN ITS FLANKS ON THE SURFACE
