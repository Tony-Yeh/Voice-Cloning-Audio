THE GORGE THROUGH WHICH THE GLACIER IS DRAINED IS RAW LOOKING DEEP AND NARROW AND INDESCRIBABLY JAGGED. THE WALLS IN MANY PLACES OVERHANG IN OTHERS THEY ARE BEVELED LOOSE AND SHIFTING WHERE THE CHANNEL HAS BEEN ERODED BY CINDERS ASHES STRATA OF FIRM LAVAS AND GLACIAL DRIFT TELLING OF MANY A CHANGE FROM FROST TO FIRE AND THEIR ATTENDANT FLOODS OF MUD AND WATER. MOST OF THE DRAINAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE IN THE POROUS ROCKS TO REAPPEAR IN SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIX HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT. SNOW LIES IN IT THE YEAR ROUND AT AN ELEVATION OF EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET AND IN SHELTERED SPOTS A THOUSAND FEET LOWER. TRACING THIS WILD CHANGING CHANNEL GORGE GULLY OR CANYON THE SECTIONS WILL SHOW MOUNT SHASTA AS A HUGE PALIMPSEST CONTAINING THE RECORDS LAYER UPON LAYER OF STRANGELY CONTRASTED EVENTS IN ITS FIERY ICY HISTORY. BUT LOOK WELL TO YOUR FOOTING FOR THE WAY WILL TEST THE SKILL OF THE MOST CAUTIOUS MOUNTAINEERS. REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORBIT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF JUNIPER WOODS CALLED THE CEDARS TO SHEEP ROCK AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS. HERE YOU STRIKE THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE LOW DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN. SHEEP ROCK IS ABOUT TWENTY MILES FROM SISSON'S AND IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL WINTER PASTURE GROUNDS OF THE WILD SHEEP FROM WHICH IT TAKES ITS NAME. IT IS A MASS OF LAVA PRESENTING TO THE GRAY SAGE PLAIN OF SHASTA VALLEY A BOLD CRAGGY FRONT TWO THOUSAND FEET HIGH. ITS SUMMIT LIES AT AN ELEVATION OF FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND HAS SEVERAL SQUARE MILES OF COMPARATIVELY LEVEL SURFACE WHERE BUNCHGRASS GROWS AND THE SNOW DOES NOT LIE DEEP THUS ALLOWING THE HARDY SHEEP TO PICK UP A LIVING THROUGH THE WINTER MONTHS WHEN DEEP SNOWS HAVE DRIVEN THEM DOWN FROM THE LOFTY RIDGES OF SHASTA. FROM HERE IT MIGHT BE WELL TO LEAVE THE IMMEDIATE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN FOR A FEW DAYS AND VISIT THE LAVA BEDS MADE FAMOUS BY THE MODOC WAR. THEY ARE A PORTION OF A FLOW OF DENSE BLACK VESICULAR LAVA DIPPING NORTHEASTWARD AT A LOW ANGLE BUT LITTLE CHANGED AS YET BY THE WEATHER AND ABOUT AS DESTITUTE OF SOIL AS A GLACIAL PAVEMENT. THE SURFACE THOUGH SMOOTH IN A GENERAL WAY AS SEEN FROM A DISTANCE IS DOTTED WITH HILLOCKS AND ROUGH CRATER LIKE PITS AND TRAVERSED BY A NETWORK OF YAWNING FISSURES FORMING A COMBINATION OF TOPOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS OF VERY STRIKING CHARACTER. THE WAY LIES BY MOUNT BREMER OVER STRETCHES OF GRAY SAGE PLAINS INTERRUPTED BY ROUGH LAVA SLOPES TIMBERED WITH JUNIPER AND YELLOW PINE AND WITH HERE AND THERE A GREEN MEADOW AND A STREAM. THIS IS A FAMOUS GAME REGION AND YOU WILL BE LIKELY TO MEET SMALL BANDS OF ANTELOPE MULE DEER AND WILD SHEEP. MOUNT BREMER IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP IN THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION. LARGE FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PLAINS AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE JAGGED CRAGS OF THEIR MOUNTAIN AT EVERY ALARM. WHILE TRAVELING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT FIFTY IN ONE FLOCK
