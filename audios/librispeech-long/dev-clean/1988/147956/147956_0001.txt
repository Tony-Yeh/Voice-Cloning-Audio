SHE MADE MISSUS SHIMERDA UNDERSTAND THE FRIENDLY INTENTION OF OUR VISIT AND THE BOHEMIAN WOMAN HANDLED THE LOAVES OF BREAD AND EVEN SMELLED THEM AND EXAMINED THE PIES WITH LIVELY CURIOSITY EXCLAIMING MUCH GOOD MUCH THANK. AND AGAIN SHE WRUNG GRANDMOTHER'S HAND. HE WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD SHORT AND BROAD BACKED WITH A CLOSE CROPPED FLAT HEAD AND A WIDE FLAT FACE. HIS HAZEL EYES WERE LITTLE AND SHREWD LIKE HIS MOTHER'S BUT MORE SLY AND SUSPICIOUS THEY FAIRLY SNAPPED AT THE FOOD. THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORNCAKES AND SORGHUM MOLASSES FOR THREE DAYS. THE LITTLE GIRL WAS PRETTY BUT AN TONIA THEY ACCENTED THE NAME THUS STRONGLY WHEN THEY SPOKE TO HER WAS STILL PRETTIER. I REMEMBERED WHAT THE CONDUCTOR HAD SAID ABOUT HER EYES. THEY WERE BIG AND WARM AND FULL OF LIGHT LIKE THE SUN SHINING ON BROWN POOLS IN THE WOOD. HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLOR. HER BROWN HAIR WAS CURLY AND WILD LOOKING. WITH HIM WAS ANOTHER SHIMERDA SON. EVEN FROM A DISTANCE ONE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY. HE WAS BORN LIKE THAT THE OTHERS ARE SMART. AMBROSCH HE MAKE GOOD FARMER. HE STRUCK AMBROSCH ON THE BACK AND THE BOY SMILED KNOWINGLY. AT THAT MOMENT THE FATHER CAME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BANK. HE WORE NO HAT AND HIS THICK IRON GRAY HAIR WAS BRUSHED STRAIGHT BACK FROM HIS FOREHEAD. IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRAITS I REMEMBERED IN VIRGINIA. HE WAS TALL AND SLENDER AND HIS THIN SHOULDERS STOOPED. HE LOOKED AT US UNDERSTANDINGLY THEN TOOK GRANDMOTHER'S HAND AND BENT OVER IT. I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAPED HIS OWN HANDS WERE. THEY LOOKED CALM SOMEHOW AND SKILLED. HIS EYES WERE MELANCHOLY AND WERE SET BACK DEEP UNDER HIS BROW. HIS FACE WAS RUGGEDLY FORMED BUT IT LOOKED LIKE ASHES LIKE SOMETHING FROM WHICH ALL THE WARMTH AND LIGHT HAD DIED OUT. IN A MOMENT WE WERE RUNNING UP THE STEEP DRAWSIDE TOGETHER YULKA TROTTING AFTER US. WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US. THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HAT ON AND THE GIRLS SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM. SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYES FAIRLY BLAZING WITH THINGS SHE COULD NOT SAY. NAME WHAT NAME. SHE ASKED TOUCHING ME ON THE SHOULDER. I TOLD HER MY NAME AND SHE REPEATED IT AFTER ME AND MADE YULKA SAY IT. SHE POINTED INTO THE GOLD COTTONWOOD TREE BEHIND WHOSE TOP WE STOOD AND SAID AGAIN WHAT NAME. YULKA CURLED UP LIKE A BABY RABBIT AND PLAYED WITH A GRASSHOPPER. ANTONIA POINTED UP TO THE SKY AND QUESTIONED ME WITH HER GLANCE. I TOLD HER AND SHE REPEATED THE WORD MAKING IT SOUND LIKE ICE. SHE GOT UP ON HER KNEES AND WRUNG HER HANDS. SHE POINTED TO HER OWN EYES AND SHOOK HER HEAD THEN TO MINE AND TO THE SKY NODDING VIOLENTLY. OH I EXCLAIMED BLUE BLUE SKY. SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS AND MURMURED BLUE SKY BLUE EYES AS IF IT AMUSED HER. WHILE WE SNUGGLED DOWN THERE OUT OF THE WIND SHE LEARNED A SCORE OF WORDS. SHE WAS QUICK AND VERY EAGER. WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GRASS THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE GOLD TREE IN FRONT OF US. IT WAS WONDERFULLY PLEASANT. AFTER ANTONIA HAD SAID THE NEW WORDS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE CHASED SILVER RING SHE WORE ON HER MIDDLE FINGER. ANTONIA REACHED HIM FIRST TOOK HIS HAND AND KISSED IT. WHEN I CAME UP HE TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
