WE WERE TAKING THEM SOME PROVISIONS AS THEY HAD COME TO LIVE ON A WILD PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NO GARDEN OR CHICKEN HOUSE AND VERY LITTLE BROKEN LAND. FUCHS BROUGHT UP A SACK OF POTATOES AND A PIECE OF CURED PORK FROM THE CELLAR AND GRANDMOTHER PACKED SOME LOAVES OF SATURDAY'S BREAD A JAR OF BUTTER AND SEVERAL PUMPKIN PIES IN THE STRAW OF THE WAGON BOX. WE CLAMBERED UP TO THE FRONT SEAT AND JOLTED OFF PAST THE LITTLE POND AND ALONG THE ROAD THAT CLIMBED TO THE BIG CORNFIELD. I COULD HARDLY WAIT TO SEE WHAT LAY BEYOND THAT CORNFIELD BUT THERE WAS ONLY RED GRASS LIKE OURS AND NOTHING ELSE THOUGH FROM THE HIGH WAGON SEAT ONE COULD LOOK OFF A LONG WAY. THE ROAD RAN ABOUT LIKE A WILD THING AVOIDING THE DEEP DRAWS CROSSING THEM WHERE THEY WERE WIDE AND SHALLOW. AND ALL ALONG IT WHEREVER IT LOOPED OR RAN THE SUNFLOWERS GREW SOME OF THEM WERE AS BIG AS LITTLE TREES WITH GREAT ROUGH LEAVES AND MANY BRANCHES WHICH BORE DOZENS OF BLOSSOMS. THEY MADE A GOLD RIBBON ACROSS THE PRAIRIE. OCCASIONALLY ONE OF THE HORSES WOULD TEAR OFF WITH HIS TEETH A PLANT FULL OF BLOSSOMS AND WALK ALONG MUNCHING IT THE FLOWERS NODDING IN TIME TO HIS BITES AS HE ATE DOWN TOWARD THEM. THEIR AGREEMENT WITH HIM WAS MADE BEFORE THEY LEFT THE OLD COUNTRY THROUGH A COUSIN OF HIS WHO WAS ALSO A RELATIVE OF MISSUS SHIMERDA. THEY COULD NOT SPEAK ENOUGH ENGLISH TO ASK FOR ADVICE OR EVEN TO MAKE THEIR MOST PRESSING WANTS KNOWN. IF THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE I HATE TO THINK OF THEM SPENDING THE WINTER IN THAT CAVE OF KRAJIEK'S SAID GRANDMOTHER. IT'S NO BETTER THAN A BADGER HOLE NO PROPER DUGOUT AT ALL. AND I HEAR HE'S MADE THEM PAY TWENTY DOLLARS FOR HIS OLD COOKSTOVE THAT AIN'T WORTH TEN. YES'M SAID OTTO AND HE'S SOLD EM HIS OXEN AND HIS TWO BONY OLD HORSES FOR THE PRICE OF GOOD WORK TEAMS. NOW WHY IS THAT OTTO. FUCHS WRINKLED HIS BROW AND NOSE. IT WOULD TAKE ME A LONG WHILE TO EXPLAIN. THE LAND WAS GROWING ROUGHER I WAS TOLD THAT WE WERE APPROACHING SQUAW CREEK WHICH CUT UP THE WEST HALF OF THE SHIMERDAS PLACE AND MADE THE LAND OF LITTLE VALUE FOR FARMING. AS WE APPROACHED THE SHIMERDAS DWELLING I COULD STILL SEE NOTHING BUT ROUGH RED HILLOCKS AND DRAWS WITH SHELVING BANKS AND LONG ROOTS HANGING OUT WHERE THE EARTH HAD CRUMBLED AWAY. PRESENTLY AGAINST ONE OF THOSE BANKS I SAW A SORT OF SHED THATCHED WITH THE SAME WINE COLORED GRASS THAT GREW EVERYWHERE. NEAR IT TILTED A SHATTERED WINDMILL FRAME THAT HAD NO WHEEL. WE DROVE UP TO THIS SKELETON TO TIE OUR HORSES AND THEN I SAW A DOOR AND WINDOW SUNK DEEP IN THE DRAW BANK. A LITTLE GIRL TRAILED ALONG BEHIND THEM. THE WOMAN HAD ON HER HEAD THE SAME EMBROIDERED SHAWL WITH SILK FRINGES THAT SHE WORE WHEN SHE HAD ALIGHTED FROM THE TRAIN AT BLACK HAWK. SHE WAS NOT OLD BUT SHE WAS CERTAINLY NOT YOUNG. HER FACE WAS ALERT AND LIVELY WITH A SHARP CHIN AND SHREWD LITTLE EYES. SHE SHOOK GRANDMOTHER'S HAND ENERGETICALLY. VERY GLAD VERY GLAD SHE EJACULATED. IMMEDIATELY SHE POINTED TO THE BANK OUT OF WHICH SHE HAD EMERGED AND SAID HOUSE NO GOOD HOUSE NO GOOD. GRANDMOTHER NODDED CONSOLINGLY. YOU'LL GET FIXED UP COMFORTABLE AFTER WHILE MISSUS SHIMERDA MAKE GOOD HOUSE. MY GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS SPOKE IN A VERY LOUD TONE TO FOREIGNERS AS IF THEY WERE DEAF
