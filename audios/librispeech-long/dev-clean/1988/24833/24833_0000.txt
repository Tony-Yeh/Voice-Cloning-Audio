THE TWO STRAY KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME. SOMEHOW OR OTHER CAT HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE'S IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHASES THEM FOR FUN NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY SLEEPING. AS FOR KEEPING CATS IN MY ROOM THAT'S PRETTY WELL FORGOTTEN. FOR ONE THING MOM REALLY LIKES THEM. SHE SNEAKS THE KITTENS SAUCERS OF CREAM AND BITS OF REAL HAMBURGER WHEN NO ONE'S LOOKING AND SHE LIKES TALKING TO THEM IN THE KITCHEN. SHE DOESN'T PICK THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM SURE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASTHMA. HE SCALES HIS HAT AT THE LOT OF THEM AND ROARS DOWN THE HALL TO ME HEY DAVEY. WHEN ARE YOU GETTING RID OF THESE CATS I'M NOT FIXING TO START AN ANNEX TO KATE'S CAT HOME. IT'S A REAL LEMON JUST A LOT OF PREACHING ABOUT GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENSHIP. THE SECOND SEMESTER I SWITCH TO A MUSIC COURSE. THIS IS O K WITH THE SCHOOL BUT NOT WITH POP. RIGHT AWAY WHEN I BRING HOME MY NEW PROGRAM HE SAYS HOW COME YOU'RE TAKING ONE LESS COURSE THIS HALF. I EXPLAIN THAT I'M TAKING MUSIC AND ALSO BIOLOGY ALGEBRA ENGLISH AND FRENCH MUSIC HE SNORTS. THAT'S RECREATION NOT A COURSE DO IT ON YOUR OWN TIME. POP IT'S A COURSE. YOU THINK THE SCHOOL SIGNS ME UP FOR AN HOUR OF HOME RECORD PLAYING. THEY MIGHT HE GRUNTS. HE DOES AND FOR ONCE I WIN A ROUND I KEEP MUSIC FOR THIS SEMESTER. I'LL BE LUCKY IF I HAVE TIME TO BREATHE. I GO DOWN TO THE FLOWER SHOP TO GROUSE TO TOM IT'S AFTER VALENTINE'S DAY AND BUSINESS IS SLACK AND THE BOSS IS OUT. WHY DOES POP HAVE TO COME BUTTING INTO MY BUSINESS AT SCHOOL. DOESN'T HE EVEN THINK THE SCHOOL KNOWS WHAT IT'S DOING. SOMETIMES SCHOOLS DO LET KIDS TAKE A LOT OF SOFT COURSES AND THEN THEY'RE OUT ON A LIMB LATER HUH. HE JUST LIKES TO BOSS EVERYTHING I DO. SO HE CARES HUH. BESIDES SAYS TOM HALF THE REASON YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE ALWAYS BICKERING IS THAT YOU'RE SO MUCH ALIKE ME LIKE HIM SURE. AS LONG AS THERE'S A BONE ON THE FLOOR THE TWO OF YOU WORRY IT. MISTER PALUMBO COMES BACK TO THE SHOP THEN AND TOM GETS BUSY WITH THE PLANTS. I GO HOME WONDERING IF I REALLY AM AT ALL LIKE POP. IT'S FUNNY ABOUT FIGHTS POP AND I CAN GO ALONG REAL SMOOTH AND EASY FOR A WHILE AND I THINK WELL HE REALLY ISN'T A BAD GUY AND I'M GROWING UP WE CAN SEE EYE TO EYE ALL THAT STUFF THEN WHOOSH. I HARDLY KNOW WHAT STARTS IT BUT A FIGHT BOILS UP AND WE'RE BOTH BREATHING FIRE LIKE DRAGONS ON THE LOOSE. WE GET A HOLIDAY WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE THERE'S A T V PROGRAM ON TUESDAY THE NIGHT BEFORE THE HOLIDAY THAT I HARDLY EVER GET TO WATCH IT'S CALLED OUT BEYOND AND THE PEOPLE IN IT ARE VERY REAL NOT JUST GOOD GUYS AND BAD GUYS. THE PROGRAM GOES ON TILL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND MOM WON'T LET ME WATCH IT ON SCHOOL NIGHTS. I GET THE PILLOWS COMFORTABLY ARRANGED ON THE FLOOR WITH A BIG BOTTLE OF SODA AND A BAG OF POPCORN WITHIN EASY REACH. HE'S TAKING THE KID FOR A WALK WHEN A THUNDERSTORM BLOWS UP. HE SIGNS OFF FINALLY AND UP COMES POP. HERE DAVEY OLD BOY WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT TONIGHT THE GOVERNOR AND THE MAYOR ARE ON A T V DEBATE ABOUT NEW YORK CITY SCHOOL REORGANIZATION. I JUMP UP TIPPING OVER THE BOTTLE OF SODA ON THE WAY. POP GOES RIGHT ON TUNING HIS CHANNEL. THAT'S THE LAST STRAW. POP LOOKS AT ME PRISSILY. YOU'RE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF. GO GET A SPONGE TO MOP UP THE SODA. IT'S YOUR FAULT MOP IT UP YOURSELF. I'M TOO MAD NOW TO CARE WHAT I SAY I CHARGE DOWN THE HALL TO MY ROOM AND SLAM THE DOOR. I HEAR THE T V GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO MOM. IN A LITTLE WHILE HE COMES DOWN AND KNOCKS ON MY DOOR. KNOCKS THAT'S SOMETHING USUALLY HE JUST BARGES IN. YOUR MOTHER SAYS SHE TOLD YOU YOU COULD WATCH THAT PROGRAM WHATEVER IT WAS SO O K GO AHEAD YOU CAN FINISH IT. YEAH IT'S ABOUT OVER BY NOW. I'M STILL SORE AND BESIDES POP'S STILL STANDING IN MY DOOR SO I FIGURE THERE'S A HITCH IN THIS SOMEWHERE
