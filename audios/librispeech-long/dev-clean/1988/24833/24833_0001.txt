WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN A GUY'S T V PROGRAM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT. I LOOK AT MY WATCH IT'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN. POP MOVES OUT OF THE DOORWAY. HE SAYS HEREAFTER I WILL ONLY TURN OFF YOUR T V PROGRAMS BEFORE THEY START NOT IN THE MIDDLE. JUST AS I GET THE T V ON AND SETTLE DOWN THE DOORBELL RINGS. GOODNESS WHO COULD THAT BE SO LATE SAYS MOM. I TURN OFF THE TELEVISION SET I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRANDFATHER WHO'S THE SPOOK AFTER ALL. IT'S THE FIRST TIME HILDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROUND. HILDA CAME TO THE BEACH WITH US I SAY. I TOLD TOM WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE SAYS HILDA. HILDA SITS ON THE SOFA WHERE CAT IS CURLED UP. HE LOOKS AT HER PUTS HIS HEAD BACK AND GOES ON SLEEPING. TOM STIRS HIS COFFEE VIGOROUSLY AND TAKES ONE SIP AND PUTS THE CUP DOWN. POP DOESN'T LOOK AS SURPRISED AS I DO CONGRATULATIONS HE SAYS. TOM SAYS THANKS AND LOOKS AT HILDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY. TOM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFEE AND THEN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON THIS FLOWER SHOP JOB. DOESN'T PAY ENOUGH POP ASKS WELL IT'S NOT JUST THE PAY. THE JOB ISN'T GETTING ME ANYWHERE I WANT TO GO. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL EVENING. YOU KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY. I'VE DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY. NO NOT IF I ENLIST IN THE ARMY THAT'S FOR THREE YEARS. POP SAYS YOU SOUND LIKE THE RECRUITING OFFICER HIMSELF YOU SURE OF ALL THIS. I'LL HAVE TO CHECK SOME MORE SAYS TOM. THE RECRUITING OFFICER AS A MATTER OF FACT TRIED TO PERSUADE ME TO SHOOT FOR OFFICERS TRAINING AND GO INTO THE ARMY AS A CAREER. WELL SHOVE BACK THE COFFEE CUPS AND I'LL BREAK OUT THAT BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE THAT'S BEEN SITTING IN THE ICEBOX SINCE CHRISTMAS. I GO AND RETRIEVE MY SPILLED BOTTLE OF SODA. THERE'S STILL ENOUGH LEFT FOR ONE BIG GLASS. POP BRINGS OUT THE CHAMPAGNE AND THE CORK BLOWS AND HITS THE CEILING. POP FILLS LITTLE GLASSES FOR THEM AND RAISES HIS TO TOM AND HILDA. HERE'S TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE. THAT'S TRUE AND WE ALL DRINK TO CAT
