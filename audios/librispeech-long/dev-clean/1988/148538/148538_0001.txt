IN DEMOCRACIES MEN ARE NEVER STATIONARY A THOUSAND CHANCES WAFT THEM TO AND FRO AND THEIR LIFE IS ALWAYS THE SPORT OF UNFORESEEN OR SO TO SPEAK EXTEMPORANEOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH HE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH. WHEN THE INHABITANT OF DEMOCRACIES IS NOT URGED BY HIS WANTS HE IS SO AT LEAST BY HIS DESIRES FOR OF ALL THE POSSESSIONS WHICH HE SEES AROUND HIM NONE ARE WHOLLY BEYOND HIS REACH. HE THEREFORE DOES EVERYTHING IN A HURRY HE IS ALWAYS SATISFIED WITH PRETTY WELL AND NEVER PAUSES MORE THAN AN INSTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING. HIS CURIOSITY IS AT ONCE INSATIABLE AND CHEAPLY SATISFIED FOR HE CARES MORE TO KNOW A GREAT DEAL QUICKLY THAN TO KNOW ANYTHING WELL HE HAS NO TIME AND BUT LITTLE TASTE TO SEARCH THINGS TO THE BOTTOM. THUS THEN DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES ARE GRAVE BECAUSE THEIR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITION CONSTANTLY LEADS THEM TO ENGAGE IN SERIOUS OCCUPATIONS AND THEY ACT INCONSIDERATELY BECAUSE THEY GIVE BUT LITTLE TIME AND ATTENTION TO EACH OF THESE OCCUPATIONS. THE HABIT OF INATTENTION MUST BE CONSIDERED AS THE GREATEST BANE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CHARACTER. CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTIOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH. ALL FREE NATIONS ARE VAINGLORIOUS BUT NATIONAL PRIDE IS NOT DISPLAYED BY ALL IN THE SAME MANNER. THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT OF THE SMALLEST CENSURE AND INSATIABLE OF PRAISE. THE MOST SLENDER EULOGIUM IS ACCEPTABLE TO THEM THE MOST EXALTED SELDOM CONTENTS THEM THEY UNCEASINGLY HARASS YOU TO EXTORT PRAISE AND IF YOU RESIST THEIR ENTREATIES THEY FALL TO PRAISING THEMSELVES. THEIR VANITY IS NOT ONLY GREEDY BUT RESTLESS AND JEALOUS IT WILL GRANT NOTHING WHILST IT DEMANDS EVERYTHING BUT IS READY TO BEG AND TO QUARREL AT THE SAME TIME. IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AY HE REPLIES THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD. IF I APPLAUD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS ENJOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT. THE CENSURE OF FOREIGNERS DOES NOT AFFECT HIM AND THEIR PRAISE HARDLY FLATTERS HIM HIS POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE REST OF THE WORLD IS ONE OF DISDAINFUL AND IGNORANT RESERVE HIS PRIDE REQUIRES NO SUSTENANCE IT NOURISHES ITSELF. IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ACCRUE TO THEM. AS THESE PRIVILEGES CAME TO THEM BY INHERITANCE THEY REGARD THEM IN SOME SORT AS A PORTION OF THEMSELVES OR AT LEAST AS A NATURAL RIGHT INHERENT IN THEIR OWN PERSONS. THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VAUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERYONE PERCEIVES AND NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION. THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION. WHEN AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HAUGHTY FORM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATION. WHEN ON THE CONTRARY SOCIAL CONDITIONS DIFFER BUT LITTLE THE SLIGHTEST PRIVILEGES ARE OF SOME IMPORTANCE AS EVERY MAN SEES AROUND HIMSELF A MILLION OF PEOPLE ENJOYING PRECISELY SIMILAR OR ANALOGOUS ADVANTAGES HIS PRIDE BECOMES CRAVING AND JEALOUS HE CLINGS TO MERE TRIFLES AND DOGGEDLY DEFENDS THEM. AS AT ANY INSTANT THESE SAME ADVANTAGES MAY BE LOST THEIR POSSESSORS ARE CONSTANTLY ON THE ALERT AND MAKE A POINT OF SHOWING THAT THEY STILL RETAIN THEM
