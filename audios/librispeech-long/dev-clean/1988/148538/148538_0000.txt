MEN WHO LIVE IN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES DO NOT VALUE THE SIMPLE TURBULENT OR COARSE DIVERSIONS IN WHICH THE PEOPLE INDULGE IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES SUCH DIVERSIONS ARE THOUGHT BY THEM TO BE PUERILE OR INSIPID. NOR HAVE THEY A GREATER INCLINATION FOR THE INTELLECTUAL AND REFINED AMUSEMENTS OF THE ARISTOCRATIC CLASSES. THEY WANT SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE AND SUBSTANTIAL IN THEIR PLEASURES THEY WANT TO MIX ACTUAL FRUITION WITH THEIR JOY. IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BURSTS OF TUMULTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAYETY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCRACIES ARE NOT FOND OF BEING THUS VIOLENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGRET. AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEISURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESORT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUE TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK. HE THUS ENJOYS TWO PLEASURES HE CAN GO ON THINKING OF HIS BUSINESS AND HE CAN GET DRUNK DECENTLY BY HIS OWN FIRESIDE. I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE. IN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES EVEN POOR MEN ENTERTAIN A LOFTY NOTION OF THEIR PERSONAL IMPORTANCE THEY LOOK UPON THEMSELVES WITH COMPLACENCY AND ARE APT TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHERS ARE LOOKING AT THEM TOO. WITH THIS DISPOSITION THEY WATCH THEIR LANGUAGE AND THEIR ACTIONS WITH CARE AND DO NOT LAY THEMSELVES OPEN SO AS TO BETRAY THEIR DEFICIENCIES TO PRESERVE THEIR DIGNITY THEY THINK IT NECESSARY TO RETAIN THEIR GRAVITY. BUT I DETECT ANOTHER MORE DEEP SEATED AND POWERFUL CAUSE WHICH INSTINCTIVELY PRODUCES AMONGST THE AMERICANS THIS ASTONISHING GRAVITY. UNDER A DESPOTISM COMMUNITIES GIVE WAY AT TIMES TO BURSTS OF VEHEMENT JOY BUT THEY ARE GENERALLY GLOOMY AND MOODY BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID. THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES. THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE FORTUNE. AMONGST SUCH A PEOPLE A SERIOUS DEMEANOR CEASES TO BE PECULIAR TO CERTAIN MEN AND BECOMES A HABIT OF THE NATION. WE ARE TOLD OF SMALL DEMOCRACIES IN THE DAYS OF ANTIQUITY IN WHICH THE CITIZENS MET UPON THE PUBLIC PLACES WITH GARLANDS OF ROSES AND SPENT ALMOST ALL THEIR TIME IN DANCING AND THEATRICAL AMUSEMENTS. I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LATTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME. NO MEN ARE FONDER OF THEIR OWN CONDITION. LIFE WOULD HAVE NO RELISH FOR THEM IF THEY WERE DELIVERED FROM THE ANXIETIES WHICH HARASS THEM AND THEY SHOW MORE ATTACHMENT TO THEIR CARES THAN ARISTOCRATIC NATIONS TO THEIR PLEASURES. I AM NEXT LED TO INQUIRE HOW IT IS THAT THESE SAME DEMOCRATIC NATIONS WHICH ARE SO SERIOUS SOMETIMES ACT IN SO INCONSIDERATE A MANNER. THE AMERICANS WHO ALMOST ALWAYS PRESERVE A STAID DEMEANOR AND A FRIGID AIR NEVERTHELESS FREQUENTLY ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE BORNE AWAY FAR BEYOND THE BOUND OF REASON BY A SUDDEN PASSION OR A HASTY OPINION AND THEY SOMETIMES GRAVELY COMMIT STRANGE ABSURDITIES. THIS CONTRAST OUGHT NOT TO SURPRISE US. THERE IS ONE SORT OF IGNORANCE WHICH ORIGINATES IN EXTREME PUBLICITY. IN DESPOTIC STATES MEN KNOW NOT HOW TO ACT BECAUSE THEY ARE TOLD NOTHING IN DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THEY OFTEN ACT AT RANDOM BECAUSE NOTHING IS TO BE LEFT UNTOLD. THE FORMER DO NOT KNOW THE LATTER FORGET AND THE CHIEF FEATURES OF EACH PICTURE ARE LOST TO THEM IN A BEWILDERMENT OF DETAILS. WHEN A MAN SPEAKS IN THE MIDST OF A GREAT CROWD MANY OF HIS WORDS ARE NOT HEARD OR ARE FORTHWITH OBLITERATED FROM THE MEMORIES OF THOSE WHO HEAR THEM BUT AMIDST THE SILENCE OF A MUTE AND MOTIONLESS THRONG THE SLIGHTEST WHISPER STRIKES THE EAR
