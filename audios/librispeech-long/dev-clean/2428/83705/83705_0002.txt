IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL FOLLOW IN MY FOOTSTEPS I ENDEAVOURED TO. BUT I AM BOUND TO ADMIT THAT SO FAR MY SUCCESS HAS BEEN AS NOTHING COMPARED WITH HERS. HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS. IT IS CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE A LARGE COLLECTION OF REALLY VALUABLE PROPERTY ABOUT THE HOUSE THE WEDDING PRESENTS TO MARY ANN. SHE HAS A KNACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS. A SINGULAR FEATURE ABOUT THE SITUATION IS THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY BEGINNING TO PITY ME TO SYMPATHISE WITH ME FOR BEING ABOUT TO MARRY MARY ANN. I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS. THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARY ANN A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RANCOROUS ACIDITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE. MY BELIEF IS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO SPEND AT LEAST TWICE AS MUCH AS THEY INTENDED AND THAT THEY RESENT IT. SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE. BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND. WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARY ANN PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WHITING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO. THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MACPHERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY. I HAVE GIVEN MARY ANN TWO OR THREE TRIFLES AND I SAID SO. AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MACPHERSON HAS MARY ANN GIVEN YOU HER LOVE. SOMEONE SNIGGERED. I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SNELLINGS MOVE. BUT THAT IS NOT THE ONLY SOCIETY THE WORLD CONTAINS. AS A MATTER OF FACT MARY ANN HAS GIVEN ME A PAIR OF SLIPPERS WORKED BY HER OWN HANDS. IT IS TRUE THAT THEY ARE A TRIFLE LARGE FOR ME AND THAT I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO KEEP THEM ON MY FEET EXCEPT WHEN I AM SITTING STILL. BUT MARY ANN DOES NOT SEEM TO THINK THAT THAT MATTERS SO WHY SHOULD I. HER YOUNGEST SISTER CLARA LOUISA HAS QUITE GRATUITOUSLY INFORMED ME THAT SHE HAS HAD THEM BY HER FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME AND THAT NOT TO PUT TOO FINE A POINT ON IT THEY WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL ALTOGETHER A MISTER PILBEAM. BUT EVEN SUPPOSING THAT WHAT CLARA LOUISA SAYS IS TRUE OF WHICH I HAVE NO EVIDENCE I HAVE SURELY CAUSE TO CONGRATULATE MYSELF ON STANDING LITERALLY IN MISTER PILBEAM'S SHOES EVEN IF THEY ARE A LITTLE SPACIOUS. ON THE WHOLE I DO NOT KNOW THAT I REGRET THAT ACCIDENT I HAD WITH MARY ANN. IT IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I AM A LITTLE DISPOSED TO WISH THAT SHE WERE NOT QUITE SO GOOD A MANAGER NOW AND THEN EVERY MAN LIKES TO CALL HIS SOUL HIS OWN. ON THE OTHER HAND SHE IS WELL QUALIFIED TO PROTECT ME FROM THE REST OF THE FAMILY SHE WILL KEEP THEM AT BAY. IF SHE HAD BEEN LIKE ME THEY WOULD HAVE RENT US LIMB FROM LIMB. AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT. P S THE CARDS ARE OUT FOR THE WEDDING. IT IS TO TAKE PLACE ON TUESDAY FORTNIGHT. WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HONEYMOON TO ITALY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE. A SECOND COUSIN OF MARY ANN'S IS IN THE COOK'S TOURS LINE. HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COUPONS FOR FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE HOTEL IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT. SO THAT AS MARY ANN SAYS OUR HONEYMOON NEED COST US PRACTICALLY NOTHING. BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COUPONS AND RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DON'T USE
