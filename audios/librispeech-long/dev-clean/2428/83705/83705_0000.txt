I SAID IT MEANT NOTHING NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. ONLY I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN AND WHEN I DID EXPLAIN SHE WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND. NOT THAT I HAVE A WORD TO SAY AGAINST MARY ANN EXCEPT THAT I NEVER KNEW A GIRL WITH QUITE SO MANY RELATIONS. TO BEGIN WITH SHE HAD SIX BROTHERS AND FIVE SISTERS AND SHE IS THE ELDEST OF THE BATCH AND THERE'S NOT ONE OF THE BROTHERS WHOM I FEEL DRAWN TO. HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST. AFTER THEY HAD ARRANGED BETWEEN THEM THAT I WAS ENGAGED TO MARY ANN I WAS REALLY NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A VOICE IN THE MATTER HER FATHER REMARKED WITH A POINTED AIR WHICH I CANNOT BUT THINK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WAS UNUSUAL THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT TIME THAT I DID COME TO THE SCRATCH AND THAT IF I HAD KEPT ON DILLY DALLYING MUCH LONGER HE WOULD HAVE HAD A WORD TO SAY TO ME OF A KIND. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT AND WOULD RATHER NOT ATTEMPT TO IMAGINE. BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS. I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARY ANN'S THINGS HAD BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED. WE ARE TO LIVE IN A HOUSE WHICH BELONGS TO A COUSIN OF MISTER SNELLING IT IS TO BE FURNISHED BY A BROTHER OF MISSUS SNELLING THE HOUSE LINEN IS TO BE SUPPLIED BY THE FATHER OF THE YOUNG MAN TO WHOM JANE MATILDA IS ENGAGED AND THE IRONMONGERY BY THE UNCLE TO WHOM GEORGE FREDERIC IS APPRENTICED. ALL APPARENTLY THAT IS LEFT FOR ME TO DO IS TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING. IT IS MOST DELIGHTFUL. IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE'S WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY IN IT. THE MERE SUGGESTION IS ABSURD. THE ALTERATION WHICH HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THEIR DEMEANOUR SINCE MY ACCIDENT WITH MARY ANN IS THEREFORE ALL THE MORE AMAZING. FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE MATTER OF THE RING. THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING. I HAD BEEN WITH MARY ANN TO CHURCH AND HAD SEEN HER HOME AND HAD HAD A LITTLE SUPPER AND IT WAS AFTER SUPPER THAT IT HAPPENED. I DID NOT GO AND PURCHASE THE ENGAGEMENT RING THE FIRST THING ON THE MONDAY MORNING I OWN IT CERTAINLY NOT. NOR DID I TAKE ANY STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION DURING THE WHOLE OF THAT WEEK I WAS NOT PRESSED FOR TIME. BESIDES I WAS TURNING THINGS OVER IN MY MIND BUT THAT WAS NO REASON WHY THE MONDAY WEEK FOLLOWING FOUR OF HER BROTHERS SHOULD HAVE CALLED ON ME ON THEIR WAY TO THE OFFICE WHEN I WAS SCARCELY OUT OF BED AND ACTUALLY BREAKFASTING AND ASSAILED ME IN THE WAY IN WHICH THEY DID. THERE WAS WILLIAM HENRY JOHN FRANK FERDINAND AUGUSTUS AND STEPHEN ARTHUR. EACH OF THEM TWICE MY SIZE AND ALL OF THEM FRIGHTFULLY IGNORANT AND WHOLLY REGARDLESS OF THE SENSITIVE LITTLE POINTS OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY CAME IN CONTACT. THERE IS NO CIRCUMLOCUTION ABOUT THEM. THEY GO STRAIGHT AT WHAT THEY WANT AND WERE SCARCELY INSIDE MY DOOR BEFORE THEY BLURTED OUT THE PURPORT OF THEIR COMING. IT WAS FREDERICK AUGUSTUS IF THE THING IS POSSIBLE HE IS IF ANYTHING MORE DIRECT EVEN THAN THE REST OF HIS FAMILY. LOOK HERE WHITING HOW ABOUT MARY ANN'S RING. THE GIRL IS FRETTING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT. AND AS YOU DON'T APPEAR TO KNOW WHAT IS THE PROPER THING TO DO IN A CASE OF THIS KIND AND DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THE RING OUGHT TO BE BOUGHT STRAIGHT AWAY WE'VE BOUGHT IT FOR YOU. I GASPED POSITIVELY GASPED. AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'VE PURCHASED MY ENGAGEMENT RING. THAT'S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT. FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO'S IN THAT LINE. I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINES
