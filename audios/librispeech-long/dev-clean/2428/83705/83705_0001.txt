NO MATTER WHAT YOU WANT OR DO NOT WANT AND NEVER WILL WANT THEY ARE SURE TO HAVE SOME RELATIVE WHO HAS DEALT IN IT HIS OR HER WHOLE LIFE LONG. THEY PRODUCED THE RING AND TOLD ME WHAT I HAD TO PAY FOR IT A HANDSOME PRICE IT WAS. I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARY ANN'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT. I DID NOT WANT ANY UNPLEASANTNESS AND I AM QUITE SURE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNPLEASANTNESS HAD I DEMURRED. LATER IN THE DAY I TOOK IT WITH ME WHEN I WENT TO CALL ON MARY ANN. SHE APPEARED TO BE SURPRISED ALMOST INTO SPEECHLESSNESS WHEN I PRESENTED IT TO HER. THE MOMENTS WHEN I AM ALONE WITH MARY ANN ARE ALLEVIATIONS FOR THOSE MORE FREQUENT MOMENTS WHEN I AM NOT ALONE WITH MARY ANN. STILL I NOTICED THAT THE RING FITTED HER PERFECTLY AND I COULD NOT BUT WONDER IF SHE HAD TRIED IT ON BEFORE. IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPICION SPRINGS. THE WOMAN'S NAME IS BRADY. THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIGSTYE FOR ALL I KNOW. WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARY ANN SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PIGSTYE AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT. THE MATTER WAS TALKED ABOUT AT DINNER. MARY ANN WAS SILENT FOR SOME TIME THEN SHE QUIETLY REMARKED. DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELVES TO DISCUSS AUNT BRADY'S PROPOSAL. I SHALL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND. THIS OBSERVATION WAS FOLLOWED BY PERFECT SILENCE. THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER. MARY ANN BEAMED AT ME AND SHE SAID YOU DEAR OLD MAN. PRESENTLY SHE CONTINUED. DO YOU KNOW THAT IN MARRYING ME YOU ARE DOING THE BEST THING FOR YOURSELF THAT YOU EVER DID IN ALL YOUR LIFE. I ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN TO HER THAT I FELT SURE OF IT BUT I FEAR THAT MY EXPLANATION WAS A LITTLE STUMBLING. BUT SHE WENT ON WITH THE MOST PERFECT FLUENCY. THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE. YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO CAN LOOK AFTER YOU AND YOU COULD NOT BY ANY CHANCE HAVE CHOSEN A PERSON WHO WILL LOOK AFTER YOU BETTER THAN I SHALL. SUCH AN ASSURANCE WAS MOST SATISFACTORY. WE HAD A LONG CONFIDENTIAL CHAT ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS. I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS. I TOLD HER EXACTLY WHAT MY INCOME WAS AND THE SOURCE FROM WHICH IT CAME AND ALL ABOUT IT. SHE DREW UP A PLAN ON WHICH WE WERE TO LAY IT OUT. IT WAS AN ADMIRABLE PLAN. I HAD NEVER HAD ONE BUT I SAW CLEARLY THAT IN THAT WAY THE MONEY WOULD GO TWICE AS FAR. IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR. AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS. IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT. IT WAS WONDERFUL TO LISTEN TO HER REALLY WONDERFUL. I SHALL MAKE PAPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST. A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BUSH' AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US. I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE SHE GIVES IT. AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHIRKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER. I WILL TAKE CARE THAT MY RELATIONS DO THEIR DUTY. I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T GET IT. OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF BEING PRESENTED WITH AN ENDLESS COLLECTION OF DUPLICATES OR A LOT OF USELESS RUBBISH WHICH I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
