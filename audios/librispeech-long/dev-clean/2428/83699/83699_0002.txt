ONCE MORE I SUSPECTED THE DRIVER OF A CHUCKLE MY TEMPER WAS RISING. I HAD NOT COME ALL THAT WAY AND SUBJECTED MYSELF TO SO MUCH DISCOMFORT TO BE PLAYED TRICKS WITH. I TOLLED THE BELL AGAIN. AGAIN A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE PANE. AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND. THE STORM RUSHED IN SHE PUT UP HER HAND TO SHIELD THE LIGHT FROM DANGER. CAN I SEE MISSUS WILSON I'M EXPECTED. I'M MISTER CHRISTOPHER FROM LONDON. OH THAT WAS ALL SHE SAID. I LOOKED AT HER SHE AT ME. THE DRIVER'S VOICE CAME FROM THE BACKGROUND I DROVE HIM OVER FROM THE STATION MISS THERE BE A LOT OF LUGGAGE. HE DO SAY HE'S COME TO STAY WITH YOU IS THAT YOU TIDY. I'M AFRAID I CAN OFFER YOU NOTHING TO DRINK. WE'VE LOST THE KEY OF THE CELLAR AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT. I CAN'T SAY RIGHTLY AS HOW I SHOULD MISS. NEXT TIME WILL DO BE IT ALL RIGHT. THE GIRL CONTINUED TO REGARD ME. PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER COME INSIDE I THINK I HAD. I WENT INSIDE IT WAS TIME. HAVE YOU ANY LUGGAGE I ADMITTED THAT I HAD. PERHAPS IT HAD BETTER BE BROUGHT IN PERHAPS IT HAD. DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD MANAGE TIDY
