THAT WAS THE ADVERTISEMENT IT HAD ITS POINTS. I WAS NOT SURE WHAT IN THIS CASE AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS MIGHT HAPPEN TO MEAN. I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP IN MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTIVE SEASON. FESTIVE YES. SO I WROTE TO THE ADVERTISER. THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN IN A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAGUE. IT APPEARED THAT THE TERMS WOULD BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT FEE WOULD COVER. I MIGHT ARRIVE IT SEEMED ON CHRISTMAS EVE BUT THERE WAS NO HINT AS TO WHEN I WAS TO GO IF EVER. THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE ODD. THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMODATION WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT. THE LETTER WAS SIGNED MADGE WILSON. NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PREDILECTION FOR THE NAME MADGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY. I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MADGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE. HERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY OFFERED. SHE WAS APPARENTLY THE CAREWORN MOTHER OF A LIVELY FAMILY. UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MADGE AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED ME TO GO. I HAD NO ILLUSIONS. I DID NOT EXPECT A PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT. STILL I FELT THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP OR COUSIN LUCY THE SUBJECTS OF HER CONVERSATION I NEVER CARED ABOUT WHEN THEY WERE ALIVE AND I CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEM NOW THEY ARE DEAD. AS FOR THE PILLS AND DROPS WITH WHICH HER HUSBAND DOSES HIMSELF BETWEEN THE COURSES IT MAKES ME ILL EVEN TO THINK OF THEM. ON CHRISTMAS EVE THE WEATHER WAS ABOMINABLE. ALL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING AND RAINING. IN THE MORNING IT BEGAN TO FREEZE. BY THE TIME THE STREETS WERE LIKE SO MANY SKATING RINKS IT COMMENCED TO SNOW. AND IT KEPT ON SNOWING THAT TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE A RECORD IN THE WAY OF SNOW STORMS. HARDLY THE SORT OF WEATHER TO START FOR AN UNKNOWN DESTINATION IN THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY BUT AT THE LAST MOMENT I DID NOT LIKE TO BACK OUT I SAID I WOULD GO AND I MEANT TO GO. I HAD BEEN IDIOT ENOUGH TO LOAD MYSELF WITH A LOT OF CHRISTMAS PRESENTS WITHOUT THE FAINTEST NOTION WHY. I HAD NOT GIVEN A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR YEARS THERE HAD BEEN NO ONE TO GIVE THEM TO. LUCY CANNOT BEAR SUCH TRIFLING AND HER HUSBAND'S ONLY NOTION OF A PRESENT AT ANY TIME WAS A GALLON JAR OF SOMEBODY'S STOMACH STIRRER. I AM NO DEALER IN POISONS. I KNEW NOTHING OF THE PEOPLE I WAS GOING TO. THE YOUNGEST MEMBER OF THE FAMILY MIGHT BE TWENTY OR THE OLDEST TEN. STILL IF YOU HAVE NOT TRIED YOUR HAND AT THAT KIND OF THING FOR EVER SO LONG THE MERE ACT OF PURCHASING IS A PLEASURE THAT IS A FACT. I HAD NEVER ENJOYED SHOPPING SO MUCH SINCE I WAS A BOY. I FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS. I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MADGE I MEAN MISSUS WILSON. I HOPED TO GOODNESS THAT HE WOULD NOT PROVE TO BE A HYPOCHONDRIAC LIKE LUCY'S HUSBAND I WOULD NOT GIVE HIM PILLS. WHAT THE LIVELY FAMILY WOULD THINK OF A PERFECT STRANGER ARRIVING BURDENED WITH RUBBISH AS IF HE HAD KNOWN THEM ALL THEIR LIVES I DID NOT DARE TO THINK. NO DOUBT THEY WOULD SET HIM DOWN AS A LUNATIC RIGHT AWAY. IT WAS A HORRIBLE JOURNEY. THE TRAINS WERE LATE AND OF COURSE OVERCROWDED THERE WAS ENOUGH LUGGAGE IN OUR COMPARTMENT TO HAVE FILLED IT AND STILL THERE WAS ONE MORE PASSENGER THAN THERE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN AN ILL CONDITIONED OLD FELLOW WHO WANTED MY HAT BOX PUT INTO THE VAN BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO TUMBLE OFF THE RACK ON TO HIS HEAD. I POINTED OUT TO HIM THAT THE RACK WAS SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED FOR LIGHT LUGGAGE THAT A HAT BOX WAS LIGHT LUGGAGE AND THAT IF THE TRAIN JOLTED HE OUGHT TO BLAME THE COMPANY NOT ME
