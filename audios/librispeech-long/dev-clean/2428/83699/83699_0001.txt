HE WAS IMPERVIOUS TO REASON. HIS WRANGLING AND JANGLING SO UPSET ME THAT I WENT PAST THE STATION AT WHICH I OUGHT TO HAVE CHANGED. THEN I HAD TO WAIT THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR FOR A TRAIN TO TAKE ME BACK AGAIN ONLY TO FIND THAT I HAD MISSED THE ONE I INTENDED TO CATCH. IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF. WHEN THE TRAIN DID START SOME FORTY MINUTES AFTER SCHEDULED TIME IT JOLTED ALONG IN A LABORIOUS FASHION AT THE RATE OF ABOUT SIX MILES AN HOUR STOPPING AT EVERY ROADSIDE HOVEL. I COUNTED SEVEN IN A DISTANCE I AM CONVINCED OF LESS THAN TWENTY MILES. WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CROFTON MY JOURNEY'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WITTED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STATIONMASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HULKING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO. NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HANGAR DENE THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOUGHED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION. THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BOY AND BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FETCHING. FINALLY THE HULKING LAD WAS DISPATCHED. IT TOOK HIM SOME TIME CONSIDERING THE DISTANCE WAS ONLY ABOUT HALF A MILE. WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OPEN SPRING CART. IN IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LUGGAGE. THE SNOW WAS STILL DESCENDING IN WHIRLING CLOUDS. NEVER SHALL I FORGET THE DRIVE IN THAT MISERABLE CART THROUGH THE STORM AND THOSE PITCH BLACK COUNTRY LANES. BE YOU GOING TO STOP WITH THEY WILSONS I AM AH. IT BE ABOUT TIME AS SOMEONE WERE TO STAY WITH THEM AS WERE A BIT CAPABLE LIKE. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT. I DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT. I WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY. I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE. BETTER COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF THE FESTIVE SEASON. WE PASSED THROUGH A GATE WHICH I HAD TO GET DOWN TO OPEN ALONG SOME SORT OF AVENUE. SUDDENLY THE CART PULLED UP. HERE WE BE THAT MIGHT BE SO. IT WAS A PITY HE DID NOT ADD WHERE HERE WAS. THERE WAS A GREAT SHADOW WHICH POSSIBLY DID DUTY FOR A HOUSE BUT IF SO THERE WAS NOT A LIGHT IN ANY OF THE WINDOWS AND THERE WAS NOTHING VISIBLE IN THE SHAPE OF A DOOR. THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND EM. THERE'S A KNOCKER IF NONE OF EM HAVEN'T TWISTED IT OFF. IF THEY HAVE THERE'S A BELL ON YOUR RIGHT IF IT ISN'T BROKEN. THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNOCKER THOUGH WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SAY. I HEARD IT TINKLE IN THE DISTANCE. NO ANSWER THOUGH I ALLOWED A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVAL. BETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD. MAYBE THEY'RE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROUSING. WAS THERE A CHUCKLE IN THE FELLOW'S VOICE. I RANG AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH ALL THE FORCE I COULD. THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE. IS THERE NO ONE IN THE PLACE. THEY'RE THERE RIGHT ENOUGH WHERE'S ANOTHER THING. MAYBE ON THE ROOF OR IN THE CELLAR. I SOUNDED ANOTHER PEAL. PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PAIRS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR. A VOICE INQUIRED WHO'S THERE. MISTER CHRISTOPHER FROM LONDON. THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER. THERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE. WHO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE MAD. WELL THEREABOUTS
