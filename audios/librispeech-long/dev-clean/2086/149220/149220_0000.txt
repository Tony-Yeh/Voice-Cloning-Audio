THE ENCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONTRACTED WITHIN SMALL COMPASS AND HEMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGH WOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUTBUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD ON ANOTHER STREET. IN ITS CENTRE WAS A GRASS PLAT SURROUNDING A RUINOUS LITTLE STRUCTURE WHICH SHOWED JUST ENOUGH OF ITS ORIGINAL DESIGN TO INDICATE THAT IT HAD ONCE BEEN A SUMMER HOUSE. A HOP VINE SPRINGING FROM LAST YEAR'S ROOT WAS BEGINNING TO CLAMBER OVER IT BUT WOULD BE LONG IN COVERING THE ROOF WITH ITS GREEN MANTLE. THREE OF THE SEVEN GABLES EITHER FRONTED OR LOOKED SIDEWAYS WITH A DARK SOLEMNITY OF ASPECT DOWN INTO THE GARDEN. THE BLACK RICH SOIL HAD FED ITSELF WITH THE DECAY OF A LONG PERIOD OF TIME SUCH AS FALLEN LEAVES THE PETALS OF FLOWERS AND THE STALKS AND SEED VESSELS OF VAGRANT AND LAWLESS PLANTS MORE USEFUL AFTER THEIR DEATH THAN EVER WHILE FLAUNTING IN THE SUN. THE EVIL OF THESE DEPARTED YEARS WOULD NATURALLY HAVE SPRUNG UP AGAIN IN SUCH RANK WEEDS SYMBOLIC OF THE TRANSMITTED VICES OF SOCIETY AS ARE ALWAYS PRONE TO ROOT THEMSELVES ABOUT HUMAN DWELLINGS. PHOEBE SAW HOWEVER THAT THEIR GROWTH MUST HAVE BEEN CHECKED BY A DEGREE OF CAREFUL LABOR BESTOWED DAILY AND SYSTEMATICALLY ON THE GARDEN. THE WHITE DOUBLE ROSEBUSH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PROPPED UP ANEW AGAINST THE HOUSE SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON AND A PEAR TREE AND THREE DAMSON TREES WHICH EXCEPT A ROW OF CURRANT BUSHES CONSTITUTED THE ONLY VARIETIES OF FRUIT BORE MARKS OF THE RECENT AMPUTATION OF SEVERAL SUPERFLUOUS OR DEFECTIVE LIMBS. THERE WERE ALSO A FEW SPECIES OF ANTIQUE AND HEREDITARY FLOWERS IN NO VERY FLOURISHING CONDITION BUT SCRUPULOUSLY WEEDED AS IF SOME PERSON EITHER OUT OF LOVE OR CURIOSITY HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO BRING THEM TO SUCH PERFECTION AS THEY WERE CAPABLE OF ATTAINING. THE REMAINDER OF THE GARDEN PRESENTED A WELL SELECTED ASSORTMENT OF ESCULENT VEGETABLES IN A PRAISEWORTHY STATE OF ADVANCEMENT. SUMMER SQUASHES ALMOST IN THEIR GOLDEN BLOSSOM CUCUMBERS NOW EVINCING A TENDENCY TO SPREAD AWAY FROM THE MAIN STOCK AND RAMBLE FAR AND WIDE TWO OR THREE ROWS OF STRING BEANS AND AS MANY MORE THAT WERE ABOUT TO FESTOON THEMSELVES ON POLES TOMATOES OCCUPYING A SITE SO SHELTERED AND SUNNY THAT THE PLANTS WERE ALREADY GIGANTIC AND PROMISED AN EARLY AND ABUNDANT HARVEST. PHOEBE WONDERED WHOSE CARE AND TOIL IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT HAD PLANTED THESE VEGETABLES AND KEPT THE SOIL SO CLEAN AND ORDERLY. NOT SURELY HER COUSIN HEPZIBAH'S WHO HAD NO TASTE NOR SPIRITS FOR THE LADY LIKE EMPLOYMENT OF CULTIVATING FLOWERS AND WITH HER RECLUSE HABITS AND TENDENCY TO SHELTER HERSELF WITHIN THE DISMAL SHADOW OF THE HOUSE WOULD HARDLY HAVE COME FORTH UNDER THE SPECK OF OPEN SKY TO WEED AND HOE AMONG THE FRATERNITY OF BEANS AND SQUASHES. IT BEING HER FIRST DAY OF COMPLETE ESTRANGEMENT FROM RURAL OBJECTS PHOEBE FOUND AN UNEXPECTED CHARM IN THIS LITTLE NOOK OF GRASS AND FOLIAGE AND ARISTOCRATIC FLOWERS AND PLEBEIAN VEGETABLES. THE EYE OF HEAVEN SEEMED TO LOOK DOWN INTO IT PLEASANTLY AND WITH A PECULIAR SMILE AS IF GLAD TO PERCEIVE THAT NATURE ELSEWHERE OVERWHELMED AND DRIVEN OUT OF THE DUSTY TOWN HAD HERE BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN A BREATHING PLACE. THE SPOT ACQUIRED A SOMEWHAT WILDER GRACE AND YET A VERY GENTLE ONE FROM THE FACT THAT A PAIR OF ROBINS HAD BUILT THEIR NEST IN THE PEAR TREE AND WERE MAKING THEMSELVES EXCEEDINGLY BUSY AND HAPPY IN THE DARK INTRICACY OF ITS BOUGHS. BEES TOO STRANGE TO SAY HAD THOUGHT IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO COME HITHER POSSIBLY FROM THE RANGE OF HIVES BESIDE SOME FARM HOUSE MILES AWAY. HOW MANY AERIAL VOYAGES MIGHT THEY HAVE MADE IN QUEST OF HONEY OR HONEY LADEN BETWIXT DAWN AND SUNSET. YET LATE AS IT NOW WAS THERE STILL AROSE A PLEASANT HUM OUT OF ONE OR TWO OF THE SQUASH BLOSSOMS IN THE DEPTHS OF WHICH THESE BEES WERE PLYING THEIR GOLDEN LABOR
