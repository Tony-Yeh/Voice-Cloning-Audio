SHE REBELLED AS IT WERE AGAINST A CERTAIN MAGNETIC ELEMENT IN THE ARTIST'S NATURE WHICH HE EXERCISED TOWARDS HER POSSIBLY WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF IT. THERE SAID HOLGRAVE IT IS TIME TO GIVE OVER WORK. GOOD NIGHT MISS PHOEBE PYNCHEON. ANY BRIGHT DAY IF YOU WILL PUT ONE OF THOSE ROSEBUDS IN YOUR HAIR AND COME TO MY ROOMS IN CENTRAL STREET I WILL SEIZE THE PUREST RAY OF SUNSHINE AND MAKE A PICTURE OF THE FLOWER AND ITS WEARER. HE RETIRED TOWARDS HIS OWN SOLITARY GABLE BUT TURNED HIS HEAD ON REACHING THE DOOR AND CALLED TO PHOEBE WITH A TONE WHICH CERTAINLY HAD LAUGHTER IN IT YET WHICH SEEMED TO BE MORE THAN HALF IN EARNEST. BE CAREFUL NOT TO DRINK AT MAULE'S WELL SAID HE. NEITHER DRINK NOR BATHE YOUR FACE IN IT. MAULE'S WELL ANSWERED PHOEBE. IS THAT IT WITH THE RIM OF MOSSY STONES. OH REJOINED THE DAGUERREOTYPIST BECAUSE LIKE AN OLD LADY'S CUP OF TEA IT IS WATER BEWITCHED. HE VANISHED AND PHOEBE LINGERING A MOMENT SAW A GLIMMERING LIGHT AND THEN THE STEADY BEAM OF A LAMP IN A CHAMBER OF THE GABLE. ON RETURNING INTO HEPZIBAH'S APARTMENT OF THE HOUSE SHE FOUND THE LOW STUDDED PARLOR SO DIM AND DUSKY THAT HER EYES COULD NOT PENETRATE THE INTERIOR. SHE WAS INDISTINCTLY AWARE HOWEVER THAT THE GAUNT FIGURE OF THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN WAS SITTING IN ONE OF THE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIRS A LITTLE WITHDRAWN FROM THE WINDOW THE FAINT GLEAM OF WHICH SHOWED THE BLANCHED PALENESS OF HER CHEEK TURNED SIDEWAYS TOWARDS A CORNER. SHALL I LIGHT A LAMP COUSIN HEPZIBAH SHE ASKED. DO IF YOU PLEASE MY DEAR CHILD ANSWERED HEPZIBAH. BUT PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE PASSAGE. MY EYES ARE WEAK AND I CAN SELDOM BEAR THE LAMPLIGHT ON THEM. WHAT AN INSTRUMENT IS THE HUMAN VOICE. HOW WONDERFULLY RESPONSIVE TO EVERY EMOTION OF THE HUMAN SOUL. IN HEPZIBAH'S TONE AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A CERTAIN RICH DEPTH AND MOISTURE AS IF THE WORDS COMMONPLACE AS THEY WERE HAD BEEN STEEPED IN THE WARMTH OF HER HEART. AGAIN WHILE LIGHTING THE LAMP IN THE KITCHEN PHOEBE FANCIED THAT HER COUSIN SPOKE TO HER. IN A MOMENT COUSIN ANSWERED THE GIRL. THESE MATCHES JUST GLIMMER AND GO OUT. BUT INSTEAD OF A RESPONSE FROM HEPZIBAH SHE SEEMED TO HEAR THE MURMUR OF AN UNKNOWN VOICE. IT WAS STRANGELY INDISTINCT HOWEVER AND LESS LIKE ARTICULATE WORDS THAN AN UNSHAPED SOUND SUCH AS WOULD BE THE UTTERANCE OF FEELING AND SYMPATHY RATHER THAN OF THE INTELLECT. SO VAGUE WAS IT THAT ITS IMPRESSION OR ECHO IN PHOEBE'S MIND WAS THAT OF UNREALITY. SHE SET THE LIGHTED LAMP IN THE PASSAGE AND AGAIN ENTERED THE PARLOR. HEPZIBAH'S FORM THOUGH ITS SABLE OUTLINE MINGLED WITH THE DUSK WAS NOW LESS IMPERFECTLY VISIBLE. IN THE REMOTER PARTS OF THE ROOM HOWEVER ITS WALLS BEING SO ILL ADAPTED TO REFLECT LIGHT THERE WAS NEARLY THE SAME OBSCURITY AS BEFORE. COUSIN SAID PHOEBE DID YOU SPEAK TO ME JUST NOW. NO CHILD REPLIED HEPZIBAH. FEWER WORDS THAN BEFORE BUT WITH THE SAME MYSTERIOUS MUSIC IN THEM. MELLOW MELANCHOLY YET NOT MOURNFUL THE TONE SEEMED TO GUSH UP OUT OF THE DEEP WELL OF HEPZIBAH'S HEART ALL STEEPED IN ITS PROFOUNDEST EMOTION. THERE WAS A TREMOR IN IT TOO THAT AS ALL STRONG FEELING IS ELECTRIC PARTLY COMMUNICATED ITSELF TO PHOEBE. THE GIRL SAT SILENTLY FOR A MOMENT. BUT SOON HER SENSES BEING VERY ACUTE SHE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF AN IRREGULAR RESPIRATION IN AN OBSCURE CORNER OF THE ROOM. HER PHYSICAL ORGANIZATION MOREOVER BEING AT ONCE DELICATE AND HEALTHY GAVE HER A PERCEPTION OPERATING WITH ALMOST THE EFFECT OF A SPIRITUAL MEDIUM THAT SOMEBODY WAS NEAR AT HAND. MY DEAR COUSIN ASKED SHE OVERCOMING AN INDEFINABLE RELUCTANCE IS THERE NOT SOME ONE IN THE ROOM WITH US. PHOEBE MY DEAR LITTLE GIRL SAID HEPZIBAH AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE YOU WERE UP BETIMES AND HAVE BEEN BUSY ALL DAY. PRAY GO TO BED FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST NEED REST
