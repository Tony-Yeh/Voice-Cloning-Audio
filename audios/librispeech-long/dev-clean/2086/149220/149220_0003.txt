NOW THE REMARKABLE POINT IS THAT THE ORIGINAL WEARS TO THE WORLD'S EYE AND FOR AUGHT I KNOW TO HIS MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS AN EXCEEDINGLY PLEASANT COUNTENANCE INDICATIVE OF BENEVOLENCE OPENNESS OF HEART SUNNY GOOD HUMOR AND OTHER PRAISEWORTHY QUALITIES OF THAT CAST. THE SUN AS YOU SEE TELLS QUITE ANOTHER STORY AND WILL NOT BE COAXED OUT OF IT AFTER HALF A DOZEN PATIENT ATTEMPTS ON MY PART. HERE WE HAVE THE MAN SLY SUBTLE HARD IMPERIOUS AND WITHAL COLD AS ICE LOOK AT THAT EYE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE AT ITS MERCY. AT THAT MOUTH COULD IT EVER SMILE. AND YET IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE THE BENIGN SMILE OF THE ORIGINAL. IT IS SO MUCH THE MORE UNFORTUNATE AS HE IS A PUBLIC CHARACTER OF SOME EMINENCE AND THE LIKENESS WAS INTENDED TO BE ENGRAVED. WELL I DON'T WISH TO SEE IT ANY MORE OBSERVED PHOEBE TURNING AWAY HER EYES IT IS CERTAINLY VERY LIKE THE OLD PORTRAIT. BUT MY COUSIN HEPZIBAH HAS ANOTHER PICTURE A MINIATURE. IF THE ORIGINAL IS STILL IN THE WORLD I THINK HE MIGHT DEFY THE SUN TO MAKE HIM LOOK STERN AND HARD. YOU HAVE SEEN THAT PICTURE THEN EXCLAIMED THE ARTIST WITH AN EXPRESSION OF MUCH INTEREST. I NEVER DID BUT HAVE A GREAT CURIOSITY TO DO SO. AND YOU JUDGE FAVORABLY OF THE FACE. THERE NEVER WAS A SWEETER ONE SAID PHOEBE. IT IS ALMOST TOO SOFT AND GENTLE FOR A MAN'S. IS THERE NOTHING WILD IN THE EYE CONTINUED HOLGRAVE SO EARNESTLY THAT IT EMBARRASSED PHOEBE AS DID ALSO THE QUIET FREEDOM WITH WHICH HE PRESUMED ON THEIR SO RECENT ACQUAINTANCE. IS THERE NOTHING DARK OR SINISTER ANYWHERE. COULD YOU NOT CONCEIVE THE ORIGINAL TO HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF A GREAT CRIME. IT IS NONSENSE SAID PHOEBE A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT A PICTURE WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN. YOU MISTAKE IT FOR SOME OTHER A CRIME INDEED. SINCE YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN HEPZIBAH'S YOU SHOULD ASK HER TO SHOW YOU THE PICTURE. IT WILL SUIT MY PURPOSE STILL BETTER TO SEE THE ORIGINAL REPLIED THE DAGUERREOTYPIST COOLLY. AS TO HIS CHARACTER WE NEED NOT DISCUSS ITS POINTS THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN SETTLED BY A COMPETENT TRIBUNAL OR ONE WHICH CALLED ITSELF COMPETENT BUT STAY. DO NOT GO YET IF YOU PLEASE I HAVE A PROPOSITION TO MAKE YOU. PHOEBE WAS ON THE POINT OF RETREATING BUT TURNED BACK WITH SOME HESITATION FOR SHE DID NOT EXACTLY COMPREHEND HIS MANNER ALTHOUGH ON BETTER OBSERVATION ITS FEATURE SEEMED RATHER TO BE LACK OF CEREMONY THAN ANY APPROACH TO OFFENSIVE RUDENESS. THERE WAS AN ODD KIND OF AUTHORITY TOO IN WHAT HE NOW PROCEEDED TO SAY RATHER AS IF THE GARDEN WERE HIS OWN THAN A PLACE TO WHICH HE WAS ADMITTED MERELY BY HEPZIBAH'S COURTESY. IF AGREEABLE TO YOU HE OBSERVED IT WOULD GIVE ME PLEASURE TO TURN OVER THESE FLOWERS AND THOSE ANCIENT AND RESPECTABLE FOWLS TO YOUR CARE. COMING FRESH FROM COUNTRY AIR AND OCCUPATIONS YOU WILL SOON FEEL THE NEED OF SOME SUCH OUT OF DOOR EMPLOYMENT. MY OWN SPHERE DOES NOT SO MUCH LIE AMONG FLOWERS. YOU CAN TRIM AND TEND THEM THEREFORE AS YOU PLEASE AND I WILL ASK ONLY THE LEAST TRIFLE OF A BLOSSOM NOW AND THEN IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL THE GOOD HONEST KITCHEN VEGETABLES WITH WHICH I PROPOSE TO ENRICH MISS HEPZIBAH'S TABLE. SO WE WILL BE FELLOW LABORERS SOMEWHAT ON THE COMMUNITY SYSTEM. SILENTLY AND RATHER SURPRISED AT HER OWN COMPLIANCE PHOEBE ACCORDINGLY BETOOK HERSELF TO WEEDING A FLOWER BED BUT BUSIED HERSELF STILL MORE WITH COGITATIONS RESPECTING THIS YOUNG MAN WITH WHOM SHE SO UNEXPECTEDLY FOUND HERSELF ON TERMS APPROACHING TO FAMILIARITY. SHE DID NOT ALTOGETHER LIKE HIM. HIS CHARACTER PERPLEXED THE LITTLE COUNTRY GIRL AS IT MIGHT A MORE PRACTISED OBSERVER FOR WHILE THE TONE OF HIS CONVERSATION HAD GENERALLY BEEN PLAYFUL THE IMPRESSION LEFT ON HER MIND WAS THAT OF GRAVITY AND EXCEPT AS HIS YOUTH MODIFIED IT ALMOST STERNNESS
