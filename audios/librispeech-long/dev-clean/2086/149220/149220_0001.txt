THERE WAS ONE OTHER OBJECT IN THE GARDEN WHICH NATURE MIGHT FAIRLY CLAIM AS HER INALIENABLE PROPERTY IN SPITE OF WHATEVER MAN COULD DO TO RENDER IT HIS OWN. THIS WAS A FOUNTAIN SET ROUND WITH A RIM OF OLD MOSSY STONES AND PAVED IN ITS BED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF MOSAIC WORK OF VARIOUSLY COLORED PEBBLES. THE PLAY AND SLIGHT AGITATION OF THE WATER IN ITS UPWARD GUSH WROUGHT MAGICALLY WITH THESE VARIEGATED PEBBLES AND MADE A CONTINUALLY SHIFTING APPARITION OF QUAINT FIGURES VANISHING TOO SUDDENLY TO BE DEFINABLE. THENCE SWELLING OVER THE RIM OF MOSS GROWN STONES THE WATER STOLE AWAY UNDER THE FENCE THROUGH WHAT WE REGRET TO CALL A GUTTER RATHER THAN A CHANNEL. NOR MUST WE FORGET TO MENTION A HEN COOP OF VERY REVEREND ANTIQUITY THAT STOOD IN THE FARTHER CORNER OF THE GARDEN NOT A GREAT WAY FROM THE FOUNTAIN. IT NOW CONTAINED ONLY CHANTICLEER HIS TWO WIVES AND A SOLITARY CHICKEN. ALL OF THEM WERE PURE SPECIMENS OF A BREED WHICH HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED DOWN AS AN HEIRLOOM IN THE PYNCHEON FAMILY AND WERE SAID WHILE IN THEIR PRIME TO HAVE ATTAINED ALMOST THE SIZE OF TURKEYS AND ON THE SCORE OF DELICATE FLESH TO BE FIT FOR A PRINCE'S TABLE. IN PROOF OF THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS LEGENDARY RENOWN HEPZIBAH COULD HAVE EXHIBITED THE SHELL OF A GREAT EGG WHICH AN OSTRICH NEED HARDLY HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF. BE THAT AS IT MIGHT THE HENS WERE NOW SCARCELY LARGER THAN PIGEONS AND HAD A QUEER RUSTY WITHERED ASPECT AND A GOUTY KIND OF MOVEMENT AND A SLEEPY AND MELANCHOLY TONE THROUGHOUT ALL THE VARIATIONS OF THEIR CLUCKING AND CACKLING. IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE RACE HAD DEGENERATED LIKE MANY A NOBLE RACE BESIDES IN CONSEQUENCE OF TOO STRICT A WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP IT PURE. THESE FEATHERED PEOPLE HAD EXISTED TOO LONG IN THEIR DISTINCT VARIETY A FACT OF WHICH THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVES JUDGING BY THEIR LUGUBRIOUS DEPORTMENT SEEMED TO BE AWARE. THEY KEPT THEMSELVES ALIVE UNQUESTIONABLY AND LAID NOW AND THEN AN EGG AND HATCHED A CHICKEN NOT FOR ANY PLEASURE OF THEIR OWN BUT THAT THE WORLD MIGHT NOT ABSOLUTELY LOSE WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SO ADMIRABLE A BREED OF FOWLS. THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF THE HENS WAS A CREST OF LAMENTABLY SCANTY GROWTH IN THESE LATTER DAYS BUT SO ODDLY AND WICKEDLY ANALOGOUS TO HEPZIBAH'S TURBAN THAT PHOEBE TO THE POIGNANT DISTRESS OF HER CONSCIENCE BUT INEVITABLY WAS LED TO FANCY A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE BETWIXT THESE FORLORN BIPEDS AND HER RESPECTABLE RELATIVE. THE GIRL RAN INTO THE HOUSE TO GET SOME CRUMBS OF BREAD COLD POTATOES AND OTHER SUCH SCRAPS AS WERE SUITABLE TO THE ACCOMMODATING APPETITE OF FOWLS. RETURNING SHE GAVE A PECULIAR CALL WHICH THEY SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE. THE CHICKEN CREPT THROUGH THE PALES OF THE COOP AND RAN WITH SOME SHOW OF LIVELINESS TO HER FEET WHILE CHANTICLEER AND THE LADIES OF HIS HOUSEHOLD REGARDED HER WITH QUEER SIDELONG GLANCES AND THEN CROAKED ONE TO ANOTHER AS IF COMMUNICATING THEIR SAGE OPINIONS OF HER CHARACTER. SO WISE AS WELL AS ANTIQUE WAS THEIR ASPECT AS TO GIVE COLOR TO THE IDEA NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF A TIME HONORED RACE BUT THAT THEY HAD EXISTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY EVER SINCE THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES WAS FOUNDED AND WERE SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH ITS DESTINY. THEY WERE A SPECIES OF TUTELARY SPRITE OR BANSHEE ALTHOUGH WINGED AND FEATHERED DIFFERENTLY FROM MOST OTHER GUARDIAN ANGELS. HERE YOU ODD LITTLE CHICKEN SAID PHOEBE HERE ARE SOME NICE CRUMBS FOR YOU. THE CHICKEN HEREUPON THOUGH ALMOST AS VENERABLE IN APPEARANCE AS ITS MOTHER POSSESSING INDEED THE WHOLE ANTIQUITY OF ITS PROGENITORS IN MINIATURE MUSTERED VIVACITY ENOUGH TO FLUTTER UPWARD AND ALIGHT ON PHOEBE'S SHOULDER. THAT LITTLE FOWL PAYS YOU A HIGH COMPLIMENT SAID A VOICE BEHIND PHOEBE. TURNING QUICKLY SHE WAS SURPRISED AT SIGHT OF A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD FOUND ACCESS INTO THE GARDEN BY A DOOR OPENING OUT OF ANOTHER GABLE THAN THAT WHENCE SHE HAD EMERGED
