HE HELD A HOE IN HIS HAND AND WHILE PHOEBE WAS GONE IN QUEST OF THE CRUMBS HAD BEGUN TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH DRAWING UP FRESH EARTH ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE TOMATOES. THE CHICKEN REALLY TREATS YOU LIKE AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE CONTINUED HE IN A QUIET WAY WHILE A SMILE MADE HIS FACE PLEASANTER THAN PHOEBE AT FIRST FANCIED IT. THOSE VENERABLE PERSONAGES IN THE COOP TOO SEEM VERY AFFABLY DISPOSED. YOU ARE LUCKY TO BE IN THEIR GOOD GRACES SO SOON. THEY HAVE KNOWN ME MUCH LONGER BUT NEVER HONOR ME WITH ANY FAMILIARITY THOUGH HARDLY A DAY PASSES WITHOUT MY BRINGING THEM FOOD. MISS HEPZIBAH I SUPPOSE WILL INTERWEAVE THE FACT WITH HER OTHER TRADITIONS AND SET IT DOWN THAT THE FOWLS KNOW YOU TO BE A PYNCHEON. THE SECRET IS SAID PHOEBE SMILING THAT I HAVE LEARNED HOW TO TALK WITH HENS AND CHICKENS. AH BUT THESE HENS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN THESE HENS OF ARISTOCRATIC LINEAGE WOULD SCORN TO UNDERSTAND THE VULGAR LANGUAGE OF A BARN YARD FOWL. I PREFER TO THINK AND SO WOULD MISS HEPZIBAH THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THE FAMILY TONE FOR YOU ARE A PYNCHEON. MY NAME IS PHOEBE PYNCHEON SAID THE GIRL WITH A MANNER OF SOME RESERVE FOR SHE WAS AWARE THAT HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE DAGUERREOTYPIST OF WHOSE LAWLESS PROPENSITIES THE OLD MAID HAD GIVEN HER A DISAGREEABLE IDEA. I DID NOT KNOW THAT MY COUSIN HEPZIBAH'S GARDEN WAS UNDER ANOTHER PERSON'S CARE. YES SAID HOLGRAVE I DIG AND HOE AND WEED IN THIS BLACK OLD EARTH FOR THE SAKE OF REFRESHING MYSELF WITH WHAT LITTLE NATURE AND SIMPLICITY MAY BE LEFT IN IT AFTER MEN HAVE SO LONG SOWN AND REAPED HERE. I TURN UP THE EARTH BY WAY OF PASTIME. MY SOBER OCCUPATION SO FAR AS I HAVE ANY IS WITH A LIGHTER MATERIAL. IN SHORT I MAKE PICTURES OUT OF SUNSHINE AND NOT TO BE TOO MUCH DAZZLED WITH MY OWN TRADE I HAVE PREVAILED WITH MISS HEPZIBAH TO LET ME LODGE IN ONE OF THESE DUSKY GABLES. IT IS LIKE A BANDAGE OVER ONE'S EYES TO COME INTO IT. BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A SPECIMEN OF MY PRODUCTIONS. A DAGUERREOTYPE LIKENESS DO YOU MEAN. ASKED PHOEBE WITH LESS RESERVE FOR IN SPITE OF PREJUDICE HER OWN YOUTHFULNESS SPRANG FORWARD TO MEET HIS. I DON'T MUCH LIKE PICTURES OF THAT SORT THEY ARE SO HARD AND STERN BESIDES DODGING AWAY FROM THE EYE AND TRYING TO ESCAPE ALTOGETHER. THEY ARE CONSCIOUS OF LOOKING VERY UNAMIABLE I SUPPOSE AND THEREFORE HATE TO BE SEEN. IF YOU WOULD PERMIT ME SAID THE ARTIST LOOKING AT PHOEBE I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY WHETHER THE DAGUERREOTYPE CAN BRING OUT DISAGREEABLE TRAITS ON A PERFECTLY AMIABLE FACE. BUT THERE CERTAINLY IS TRUTH IN WHAT YOU HAVE SAID. MOST OF MY LIKENESSES DO LOOK UNAMIABLE BUT THE VERY SUFFICIENT REASON I FANCY IS BECAUSE THE ORIGINALS ARE SO. THERE IS A WONDERFUL INSIGHT IN HEAVEN'S BROAD AND SIMPLE SUNSHINE. WHILE WE GIVE IT CREDIT ONLY FOR DEPICTING THE MEREST SURFACE IT ACTUALLY BRINGS OUT THE SECRET CHARACTER WITH A TRUTH THAT NO PAINTER WOULD EVER VENTURE UPON EVEN COULD HE DETECT IT. THERE IS AT LEAST NO FLATTERY IN MY HUMBLE LINE OF ART. NOW HERE IS A LIKENESS WHICH I HAVE TAKEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND STILL WITH NO BETTER RESULT. YET THE ORIGINAL WEARS TO COMMON EYES A VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION. IT WOULD GRATIFY ME TO HAVE YOUR JUDGMENT ON THIS CHARACTER. HE EXHIBITED A DAGUERREOTYPE MINIATURE IN A MOROCCO CASE. PHOEBE MERELY GLANCED AT IT AND GAVE IT BACK. IT IS MY PURITAN ANCESTOR WHO HANGS YONDER IN THE PARLOR. TO BE SURE YOU HAVE FOUND SOME WAY OF COPYING THE PORTRAIT WITHOUT ITS BLACK VELVET CAP AND GRAY BEARD AND HAVE GIVEN HIM A MODERN COAT AND SATIN CRAVAT INSTEAD OF HIS CLOAK AND BAND. I DON'T THINK HIM IMPROVED BY YOUR ALTERATIONS. YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN OTHER DIFFERENCES HAD YOU LOOKED A LITTLE LONGER SAID HOLGRAVE LAUGHING YET APPARENTLY MUCH STRUCK. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS A MODERN FACE AND ONE WHICH YOU WILL VERY PROBABLY MEET
