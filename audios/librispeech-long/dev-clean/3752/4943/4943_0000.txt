CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE COMMANDANT'S BUTLER. RUFUS DAWES HAD BEEN A FORTNIGHT AT THE SETTLEMENT WHEN A NEW COMER APPEARED ON THE CHAIN GANG. THIS WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OF AGE THIN FAIR AND DELICATE. HIS NAME WAS KIRKLAND AND HE BELONGED TO WHAT WERE KNOWN AS THE EDUCATED PRISONERS. HE HAD BEEN A CLERK IN A BANKING HOUSE AND WAS TRANSPORTED FOR EMBEZZLEMENT THOUGH BY SOME GRAVE DOUBTS AS TO HIS GUILT WERE ENTERTAINED. SO DOUBTLESS IT WAS AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAD NOT AN UNTOWARD ACCIDENT OCCURRED. CAPTAIN BURGESS WHO WAS A BACHELOR OF THE OLD SCHOOL CONFESSED TO AN AMIABLE WEAKNESS FOR BLASPHEMY AND WAS GIVEN TO CONDEMNING THE CONVICTS EYES AND LIMBS WITH INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE. KIRKLAND BELONGED TO A METHODIST FAMILY AND OWNED A PIETY UTTERLY OUT OF PLACE IN THAT REGION. MY BLANK CRIED BURGESS. YOU BLANK BLANK IS THAT YOUR BLANK GAME. I'LL BLANK SOON CURE YOU OF THAT. AND FORTHWITH ORDERED HIM TO THE CHAIN GANG FOR INSUBORDINATION. HE WAS RECEIVED WITH SUSPICION BY THE GANG WHO DID NOT LIKE WHITE HANDED PRISONERS. TROKE BY WAY OF EXPERIMENT IN HUMAN NATURE PERHAPS PLACED HIM NEXT TO GABBETT. THE DAY WAS GOT THROUGH IN THE USUAL WAY AND KIRKLAND FELT HIS HEART REVIVE THE TOIL WAS SEVERE AND THE COMPANIONSHIP UNCOUTH BUT DESPITE HIS BLISTERED HANDS AND ACHING BACK HE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED ANYTHING SO VERY TERRIBLE AFTER ALL. WHEN THE MUSTER BELL RANG AND THE GANG BROKE UP RUFUS DAWES ON HIS SILENT WAY TO HIS SEPARATE CELL OBSERVED A NOTABLE CHANGE OF CUSTOM IN THE DISPOSITION OF THE NEW CONVICT. INSTEAD OF PLACING HIM IN A CELL BY HIMSELF TROKE WAS TURNING HIM INTO THE YARD WITH THE OTHERS. I'M NOT TO GO IN THERE SAYS THE EX BANK CLERK DRAWING BACK IN DISMAY FROM THE CLOUD OF FOUL FACES WHICH LOWERED UPON HIM. THE GOVERNOR SAYS A NIGHT IN THERE'LL TAKE THE STARCH OUT OF YE. COME IN YER GO BUT MISTER TROKE. STOW YOUR GAFF SAYS TROKE WITH ANOTHER OATH AND IMPATIENTLY STRIKING THE LAD WITH HIS THONG I CAN'T ARGUE HERE ALL NIGHT GET IN. SO KIRKLAND AGED TWENTY TWO AND THE SON OF METHODIST PARENTS WENT IN. RUFUS DAWES AMONG WHOSE SINISTER MEMORIES THIS YARD WAS NUMBERED SIGHED. SO FIERCE WAS THE GLAMOUR OF THE PLACE HOWEVER THAT WHEN LOCKED INTO HIS CELL HE FELT ASHAMED FOR THAT SIGH AND STROVE TO ERASE THE MEMORY OF IT. WHAT IS HE MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE SAID THE WRETCHED MAN TO HIMSELF AS HE HUGGED HIS MISERY CLOSE. ABOUT DAWN THE NEXT MORNING MISTER NORTH WHO AMONGST OTHER VAGARIES NOT APPROVED OF BY HIS BISHOP HAD A HABIT OF PROWLING ABOUT THE PRISON AT UNOFFICIAL HOURS WAS ATTRACTED BY A DISPUTE AT THE DOOR OF THE DORMITORY. WHAT'S THE MATTER HERE HE ASKED. A PRISONER REFRACTORY YOUR REVERENCE SAID THE WATCHMAN. WANTS TO COME OUT MISTER NORTH. MISTER NORTH CRIED A VOICE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LET ME OUT OF THIS PLACE. KIRKLAND GHASTLY PALE BLEEDING WITH HIS WOOLLEN SHIRT TORN AND HIS BLUE EYES WIDE OPEN WITH TERROR WAS CLINGING TO THE BARS. OH MISTER NORTH MISTER NORTH OH MISTER NORTH. OH FOR GOD'S SAKE MISTER NORTH. WHAT KIRKLAND CRIED NORTH WHO WAS IGNORANT OF THE VENGEANCE OF THE COMMANDANT. WHAT DO YOU DO HERE BUT KIRKLAND COULD DO NOTHING BUT CRY OH MISTER NORTH FOR GOD'S SAKE MISTER NORTH. AND BEAT ON THE BARS WITH WHITE AND SWEATING HANDS. LET HIM OUT WATCHMAN SAID NORTH.
