I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE PARADISE SAID MEEKIN. CAPTAIN FRERE SAYS THAT THE SCENERY IS DELIGHTFUL. POOR ABANDONED WRETCHES SAYS MEEKIN I SUPPOSE NOT. HOW SWEET THE MOONLIGHT SLEEPS UPON THAT BANK. ABANDONED INDEED BY GOD AND MAN ALMOST. MISTER NORTH PROVIDENCE NEVER ABANDONS THE MOST UNWORTHY OF HIS SERVANTS. NEVER HAVE I SEEN THE RIGHTEOUS FORSAKEN NOR HIS SEED BEGGING THEIR BREAD. IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH HE IS WITH US. HIS STAFF YOU KNOW MISTER NORTH REALLY THE COMMANDANT'S HOUSE IS CHARMINGLY SITUATED. MISTER NORTH SIGHED AGAIN. YOU HAVE NOT BEEN LONG IN THE COLONY MISTER MEEKIN. I DOUBT FORGIVE ME FOR EXPRESSING MYSELF SO FREELY IF YOU QUITE KNOW OF OUR CONVICT SYSTEM. AN ADMIRABLE ONE A MOST ADMIRABLE ONE SAID MEEKIN. THERE WERE A FEW MATTERS I NOTICED IN HOBART TOWN THAT DID NOT QUITE PLEASE ME THE FREQUENT USE OF PROFANE LANGUAGE FOR INSTANCE BUT ON THE WHOLE I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE SCHEME IT IS SO COMPLETE. NORTH PURSED UP HIS LIPS. YES IT IS VERY COMPLETE HE SAID ALMOST TOO COMPLETE. BUT I AM ALWAYS IN A MINORITY WHEN I DISCUSS THE QUESTION SO WE WILL DROP IT IF YOU PLEASE. IF YOU PLEASE SAID MEEKIN GRAVELY. HE HAD HEARD FROM THE BISHOP THAT MISTER NORTH WAS AN ILL CONDITIONED SORT OF PERSON WHO SMOKED CLAY PIPES HAD BEEN DETECTED IN DRINKING BEER OUT OF A PEWTER POT AND HAD BEEN HEARD TO STATE THAT WHITE NECK CLOTHS WERE OF NO CONSEQUENCE. THE DINNER WENT OFF SUCCESSFULLY. BURGESS DESIROUS PERHAPS OF FAVOURABLY IMPRESSING THE CHAPLAIN WHOM THE BISHOP DELIGHTED TO HONOUR SHUT OFF HIS BLASPHEMY FOR A WHILE AND WAS URBANE ENOUGH. YOU'LL FIND US ROUGH MISTER MEEKIN HE SAID BUT YOU'LL FIND US ALL THERE WHEN WE'RE WANTED. THIS IS A LITTLE KINGDOM IN ITSELF. CAPTAIN BURGESS HAD NEVER HEARD OF BERANGER BUT HE SMILED AS IF HE HAD LEARNT HIS WORDS BY HEART. OR LIKE SANCHO PANZA'S ISLAND SAID NORTH. YOU REMEMBER HOW JUSTICE WAS ADMINISTERED THERE. NOT AT THIS MOMENT SIR SAID BURGESS WITH DIGNITY. HE HAD BEEN OFTEN OPPRESSED BY THE NOTION THAT THE REVEREND MISTER NORTH CHAFFED HIM. PRAY HELP YOURSELF TO WINE. THANK YOU NONE SAID NORTH FILLING A TUMBLER WITH WATER I HAVE A HEADACHE. HIS MANNER OF SPEECH AND ACTION WAS SO AWKWARD THAT A SILENCE FELL UPON THE PARTY CAUSED BY EACH ONE WONDERING WHY MISTER NORTH SHOULD GROW CONFUSED AND DRUM HIS FINGERS ON THE TABLE AND STARE EVERYWHERE BUT AT THE DECANTER. MEEKIN EVER SOFTLY AT HIS EASE WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK. HAVE YOU MANY VISITORS CAPTAIN BURGESS VERY FEW. SOMETIMES A PARTY COMES OVER WITH A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE GOVERNOR AND I SHOW THEM OVER THE PLACE BUT AS A RULE WE SEE NO ONE BUT OURSELVES. I ASKED SAID MEEKIN BECAUSE SOME FRIENDS OF MINE WERE THINKING OF COMING AND WHO MAY THEY BE. DO YOU KNOW CAPTAIN FRERE. I WAS QUARTERED WITH HIM AT SARAH ISLAND. SO HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS EH. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING HIM IN SOCIETY. HE IS JUST MARRIED YOU KNOW IS HE SAID BURGESS. THE DEVIL HE IS I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT IT TOO. MISS VICKERS A CHARMING YOUNG PERSON. CAPTAIN FRERE TAKES A DEEP INTEREST IN ALL RELATING TO CONVICT DISCIPLINE WENT ON MEEKIN UNHEEDING THE INTERRUPTION AND IS ANXIOUS THAT MISSUS FRERE SHOULD SEE THIS PLACE. YES ONE OUGHTN'T TO LEAVE THE COLONY WITHOUT SEEING IT SAYS BURGESS IT'S WORTH SEEING. SO CAPTAIN FRERE THINKS. A ROMANTIC STORY CAPTAIN BURGESS HE SAVED HER LIFE YOU KNOW. AH THAT WAS A QUEER THING THAT MUTINY SAID BURGESS. WE'VE GOT THE FELLOWS HERE YOU KNOW. I SAW THEM TRIED AT HOBART TOWN SAID MEEKIN
