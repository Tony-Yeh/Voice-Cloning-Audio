YOU'VE NO AUTHORITY HERE IN ANY WAY AND BY GOD SIR IF YOU INTERFERE WITH MY DISCIPLINE SIR I'LL HAVE YOU PUT IN IRONS UNTIL YOU'RE SHIPPED OUT OF THE ISLAND. THIS OF COURSE WAS MERE BRAVADO ON THE PART OF THE COMMANDANT. NORTH KNEW WELL THAT HE WOULD NEVER DARE TO ATTEMPT ANY SUCH ACT OF VIOLENCE BUT THE INSULT STUNG HIM LIKE THE CUT OF A WHIP. HE MADE A STRIDE TOWARDS THE COMMANDANT AS THOUGH TO SEIZE HIM BY THE THROAT BUT CHECKING HIMSELF IN TIME STOOD STILL WITH CLENCHED HANDS FLASHING EYES AND BEARD THAT BRISTLED. THE TWO MEN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND PRESENTLY BURGESS'S EYES FELL BEFORE THOSE OF THE CHAPLAIN. BURGESS WHITE WITH RAGE RANG THE BELL THAT SUMMONED HIS CONVICT SERVANT. SHOW MISTER NORTH OUT HE SAID AND GO DOWN TO THE BARRACKS AND TELL TROKE THAT KIRKLAND IS TO HAVE A HUNDRED LASHES TO MORROW. I'LL SHOW YOU WHO'S MASTER HERE MY GOOD SIR. I'LL REPORT THIS TO THE GOVERNMENT SAID NORTH AGHAST. THIS IS MURDEROUS. THE GOVERNMENT MAY GO TO AND YOU TOO ROARED BURGESS GET OUT. AND GOD'S VICEREGENT AT PORT ARTHUR SLAMMED THE DOOR. NORTH RETURNED HOME IN GREAT AGITATION. THEY SHALL NOT FLOG THAT BOY HE SAID. I'LL SHIELD HIM WITH MY OWN BODY IF NECESSARY. I'LL REPORT THIS TO THE GOVERNMENT. I'LL SEE SIR JOHN FRANKLIN MYSELF. I'LL HAVE THE LIGHT OF DAY LET INTO THIS DEN OF HORRORS. NORTH TOOK DOWN A BOOK FROM THE SHELF AND TRIED TO READ BUT THE LETTERS RAN TOGETHER. I WISH I HADN'T TAKEN THAT BRANDY HE SAID FOOL THAT I AM. THEN HE BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN TO FLING HIMSELF ON THE SOFA TO READ TO PRAY. OH GOD GIVE ME STRENGTH AID ME HELP ME. I STRUGGLE BUT I AM WEAK. O LORD LOOK DOWN UPON ME. TO SEE HIM ROLLING ON THE SOFA IN AGONY TO SEE HIS WHITE FACE HIS PARCHED LIPS AND HIS CONTRACTED BROW TO HEAR HIS MOANS AND MUTTERED PRAYERS ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIM SUFFERING FROM THE PANGS OF SOME TERRIBLE DISEASE. HE OPENED THE BOOK AGAIN AND FORCED HIMSELF TO READ BUT HIS EYES WANDERED TO THE CUPBOARD. THERE LURKED SOMETHING THAT FASCINATED HIM. HE GOT UP AT LENGTH WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND FOUND A PACKET OF RED PEPPER. HE MIXED A TEASPOONFUL OF THIS IN A PANNIKIN OF WATER AND DRANK IT. IT RELIEVED HIM FOR A WHILE. I MUST KEEP MY WITS FOR TO MORROW. MEEKIN TOO WILL SUSPECT I WILL LIE DOWN. HE WENT INTO HIS BEDROOM AND FLUNG HIMSELF ON THE BED BUT ONLY TO TOSS FROM SIDE TO SIDE. SLEEP WOULD NOT COME TO HIM. IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD REACHED THE CRISIS OF A DISEASE WHICH HAD BEEN FOR DAYS GATHERING FORCE. I MUST HAVE A TEASPOONFUL HE SAID TO ALLAY THE CRAVING. TWICE HE PAUSED ON THE WAY TO THE SITTING ROOM AND TWICE WAS HE DRIVEN ON BY A POWER STRONGER THAN HIS WILL. HE REACHED IT AT LENGTH AND OPENING THE CUPBOARD PULLED OUT WHAT HE SOUGHT A BOTTLE OF BRANDY. WITH THIS IN HIS HAND ALL MODERATION VANISHED. HE RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS AND EAGERLY DRANK. THEN ASHAMED OF WHAT HE HAD DONE HE THRUST THE BOTTLE BACK AND MADE FOR HIS ROOM STILL HE COULD NOT SLEEP. THE TASTE OF THE LIQUOR MADDENED HIM FOR MORE. HE SAW IN THE DARKNESS THE BRANDY BOTTLE VULGAR AND TERRIBLE APPARITION. HE SAW ITS AMBER FLUID SPARKLE. HE HEARD IT GURGLE AS HE POURED IT OUT. HE SMELT THE NUTTY AROMA OF THE SPIRIT. HE PICTURED IT STANDING IN THE CORNER OF THE CUPBOARD AND IMAGINED HIMSELF SEIZING IT AND QUENCHING THE FIRE THAT BURNED WITHIN HIM. HE WEPT HE PRAYED HE FOUGHT WITH HIS DESIRE AS WITH A MADNESS
