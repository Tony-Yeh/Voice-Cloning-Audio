IN FACT THE RINGLEADER JOHN REX GAVE ME HIS CONFESSION AND I SENT IT TO THE BISHOP. A GREAT RASCAL PUT IN NORTH. A DANGEROUS SCHEMING COLD BLOODED VILLAIN. WELL NOW SAID MEEKIN WITH ASPERITY I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU. EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE AGAINST THAT POOR FELLOW CAPTAIN FRERE TRIED TO MAKE ME THINK THAT HIS LETTERS CONTAINED A HIDDEN MEANING BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THEY DID. HE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TRULY PENITENT FOR HIS OFFENCES A MISGUIDED BUT NOT A HYPOCRITICAL MAN IF MY KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE GOES FOR ANYTHING I HOPE HE IS SAID NORTH. I WOULDN'T TRUST HIM OH. THERE'S NO FEAR OF HIM SAID BURGESS CHEERILY IF HE GROWS UPROARIOUS WE'LL SOON GIVE HIM A TOUCH OF THE CAT. I SUPPOSE SEVERITY IS NECESSARY RETURNED MEEKIN THOUGH TO MY EARS A FLOGGING SOUNDS A LITTLE DISTASTEFUL. IT IS A BRUTAL PUNISHMENT. IT'S A PUNISHMENT FOR BRUTES SAID BURGESS AND LAUGHED PLEASED WITH THE NEAREST APPROACH TO AN EPIGRAM HE EVER MADE IN HIS LIFE. HERE ATTENTION WAS CALLED BY THE STRANGE BEHAVIOUR OF MISTER NORTH. HE HAD RISEN AND WITHOUT APOLOGY FLUNG WIDE THE WINDOW AS THOUGH HE GASPED FOR AIR. HULLO NORTH WHAT'S THE MATTER. NOTHING SAID NORTH RECOVERING HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT A SPASM. I HAVE THESE ATTACKS AT TIMES. HAVE SOME BRANDY SAID BURGESS. NO NO IT WILL PASS NO I SAY. AND SEIZING THE TUMBLER OFFERED TO HIM HE HALF FILLED IT WITH RAW SPIRIT AND SWALLOWED THE FIERY DRAUGHT AT A GULP. THE REVEREND MEEKIN EYED HIS CLERICAL BROTHER WITH HORROR THE REVEREND MEEKIN WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO CLERGYMEN WHO WORE BLACK NECKTIES SMOKED CLAY PIPES CHEWED TOBACCO AND DRANK NEAT BRANDY OUT OF TUMBLERS. HA SAID NORTH LOOKING WILDLY ROUND UPON THEM THAT'S BETTER. LET US GO ON TO THE VERANDAH SAID BURGESS IT'S COOLER THAN IN THE HOUSE. SO THEY WENT ON TO THE VERANDAH AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE LIGHTS OF THE PRISON AND LISTENED TO THE SEA LAPPING THE SHORE. THE REVEREND MISTER NORTH IN THIS COOL ATMOSPHERE SEEMED TO RECOVER HIMSELF AND CONVERSATION PROGRESSED WITH SOME SPRIGHTLINESS. BY AND BY A SHORT FIGURE SMOKING A CHEROOT CAME UP OUT OF THE DARK AND PROVED TO BE DOCTOR MACKLEWAIN WHO HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM ATTENDING THE DINNER BY REASON OF AN ACCIDENT TO A CONSTABLE AT NORFOLK BAY WHICH HAD CLAIMED HIS PROFESSIONAL ATTENTION. WELL HOW'S FORREST CRIED BURGESS. MISTER MEEKIN DOCTOR MACKLEWAIN. DEAD SAID DOCTOR MACKLEWAIN. DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU MISTER MEEKIN. CONFOUND IT ANOTHER OF MY BEST MEN GRUMBLED BURGESS. MACKLEWAIN HAVE A GLASS OF WINE. BUT MACKLEWAIN WAS TIRED AND WANTED TO GET HOME. COME ON THEN SAID NORTH. OUR ROADS LIE TOGETHER DOCTOR. YOU WON'T HAVE A NIP OF BRANDY BEFORE YOU START ASKED BURGESS NO. THEN I SHALL SEND ROUND FOR YOU IN THE MORNING MISTER MEEKIN GOOD NIGHT. MACKLEWAIN I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU A MOMENT. BEFORE THE TWO CLERGYMEN HAD GOT HALF WAY DOWN THE STEEP PATH THAT LED FROM THE COMMANDANT'S HOUSE TO THE FLAT ON WHICH THE COTTAGES OF THE DOCTOR AND CHAPLAIN WERE BUILT MACKLEWAIN REJOINED THEM. ANOTHER FLOGGING TO MORROW SAID HE GRUMBLINGLY. UP AT DAYLIGHT I SUPPOSE AGAIN. WHOM IS HE GOING TO FLOG NOW. THAT YOUNG BUTLER FELLOW OF HIS. WHAT KIRKLAND CRIED NORTH. YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY HE'S GOING TO FLOG KIRKLAND. INSUBORDINATION SAYS MACKLEWAIN FIFTY LASHES. OH THIS MUST BE STOPPED CRIED NORTH IN GREAT ALARM HE CAN'T STAND IT. I TELL YOU HE'LL DIE MACKLEWAIN
