PERHAPS YOU'LL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ALLOW ME TO BE THE BEST JUDGE OF THAT RETURNED MACKLEWAIN DRAWING UP HIS LITTLE BODY TO ITS LEAST INSIGNIFICANT STATURE. MY DEAR SIR REPLIED NORTH ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF CONCILIATING THE SURGEON YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM LATELY. HE TRIED TO DROWN HIMSELF THIS MORNING. MISTER MEEKIN EXPRESSED SOME ALARM BUT DOCTOR MACKLEWAIN RE ASSURED HIM. THAT SORT OF NONSENSE MUST BE STOPPED SAID HE A NICE EXAMPLE TO SET. I WONDER BURGESS DIDN'T GIVE HIM A HUNDRED. HE WAS PUT INTO THE LONG DORMITORY SAID NORTH YOU KNOW WHAT SORT OF A PLACE THAT IS. I DECLARE TO HEAVEN HIS AGONY AND SHAME TERRIFIED ME. WELL HE'LL BE PUT INTO THE HOSPITAL FOR A WEEK OR SO TO MORROW SAID MACKLEWAIN AND THAT'LL GIVE HIM A SPELL. IF BURGESS FLOGS HIM I'LL REPORT IT TO THE GOVERNOR CRIES NORTH IN GREAT HEAT. THE CONDITION OF THOSE DORMITORIES IS INFAMOUS. IF THE BOY HAS ANYTHING TO COMPLAIN OF WHY DON'T HE COMPLAIN. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT EVIDENCE COMPLAIN. WOULD HIS LIFE BE SAFE IF HE DID. BESIDES HE'S NOT THE SORT OF CREATURE TO COMPLAIN HE'D RATHER KILL HIMSELF. THAT'S ALL NONSENSE SAYS MACKLEWAIN. WE CAN'T FLOG A WHOLE DORMITORY ON SUSPICION I CAN'T HELP IT. THE BOY'S MADE HIS BED AND HE MUST LIE ON IT. I'LL GO BACK AND SEE BURGESS SAID NORTH. MISTER MEEKIN HERE'S THE GATE AND YOUR ROOM IS ON THE RIGHT HAND I'LL BE BACK SHORTLY. PRAY DON'T HURRY SAID MEEKIN POLITELY. YOU ARE ON AN ERRAND OF MERCY YOU KNOW EVERYTHING MUST GIVE WAY TO THAT. I SHALL FIND MY PORTMANTEAU IN MY ROOM YOU SAID YES YES. CALL THE SERVANT IF YOU WANT ANYTHING. HE SLEEPS AT THE BACK AND NORTH HURRIED OFF. AN IMPULSIVE GENTLEMAN SAID MEEKIN TO MACKLEWAIN AS THE SOUND OF MISTER NORTH'S FOOTSTEPS DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE. MACKLEWAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SERIOUSLY. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT HIM BUT I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT IT IS. HE HAS THE STRANGEST FITS AT TIMES. UNLESS IT'S A CANCER IN THE STOMACH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT CAN BE CANCER IN THE STOMACH. DEAR ME HOW DREADFUL SAYS MEEKIN AH. DOCTOR WE ALL HAVE OUR CROSSES HAVE WE NOT. HOW DELIGHTFUL THE GRASS SMELLS. THIS SEEMS A VERY PLEASANT PLACE AND I THINK I SHALL ENJOY MYSELF VERY MUCH GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT SIR I HOPE YOU WILL BE COMFORTABLE. AND LET US HOPE POOR MISTER NORTH WILL SUCCEED IN HIS LABOUR OF LOVE SAID MEEKIN SHUTTING THE LITTLE GATE AND SAVE THE UNFORTUNATE KIRKLAND GOOD NIGHT ONCE MORE. CAPTAIN BURGESS WAS SHUTTING HIS VERANDAH WINDOW WHEN NORTH HURRIED UP. CAPTAIN BURGESS MACKLEWAIN TELLS ME YOU ARE GOING TO FLOG KIRKLAND. WELL SIR WHAT OF THAT SAID BURGESS. I HAVE COME TO BEG YOU NOT TO DO SO SIR. THE LAD HAS BEEN CRUELLY PUNISHED ALREADY. HE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE TO DAY UNHAPPY CREATURE. WELL THAT'S JUST WHAT I'M FLOGGING HIM FOR. I'LL TEACH MY PRISONERS TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE. BUT HE CAN'T STAND IT SIR HE'S TOO WEAK. THAT'S MACKLEWAIN'S BUSINESS. CAPTAIN BURGESS PROTESTED NORTH I ASSURE YOU THAT HE DOES NOT DESERVE PUNISHMENT. I HAVE SEEN HIM AND HIS CONDITION OF MIND IS PITIABLE. LOOK HERE MISTER NORTH I DON'T INTERFERE WITH WHAT YOU DO TO THE PRISONER'S SOULS DON'T YOU INTERFERE WITH WHAT I DO TO THEIR BODIES. CAPTAIN BURGESS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO MOCK AT MY OFFICE. THEN DON'T YOU INTERFERE WITH ME SIR. DO YOU PERSIST IN HAVING THIS BOY FLOGGED. I'VE GIVEN MY ORDERS SIR. THEN CAPTAIN BURGESS CRIED NORTH HIS PALE FACE FLUSHING I TELL YOU THE BOY'S BLOOD WILL BE ON YOUR HEAD. I AM A MINISTER OF GOD SIR AND I FORBID YOU TO COMMIT THIS CRIME. DAMN YOUR IMPERTINENCE SIR BURST OUT BURGESS. YOU'RE A DISMISSED OFFICER OF THE GOVERNMENT SIR
