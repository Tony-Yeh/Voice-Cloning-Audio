WE WERE JUBILANT WE WERE TRIUMPHANT. OFFICERS COULD NOT CURB THE MEN TO KEEP IN LINE. DISCHARGE AFTER DISCHARGE WAS POURED INTO THE RETREATING LINE. THE FEDERAL DEAD AND WOUNDED COVERED THE GROUND. WHEN IN THE VERY MIDST OF OUR VICTORY HERE COMES AN ORDER TO HALT WHAT. HALT AFTER TODAY'S VICTORY. SIDNEY JOHNSON KILLED GENERAL GLADDEN KILLED AND A HOST OF GENERALS AND OTHER BRAVE MEN KILLED AND THE WHOLE YANKEE ARMY IN FULL RETREAT. THE VICTORY WAS COMPLETE BUT THE WORD HALT TURNED VICTORY INTO DEFEAT. THE SOLDIERS HAD PASSED THROUGH THE YANKEE CAMPS AND SAW ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT THEY HAD TO EAT IN THEIR SUTLERS STORES AND OFFICERS MARQUEES AND IT WAS BUT A SHORT TIME BEFORE EVERY SOLDIER WAS RUMMAGING TO SEE WHAT HE COULD FIND. THE HARVEST WAS GREAT AND THE LABORERS WERE NOT FEW. GREENBACKS WERE PLENTIFUL GOOD CLOTHES WERE PLENTIFUL RATIONS WERE NOT IN DEMAND THE BOYS WERE IN CLOVER. THIS WAS SUNDAY. ON MONDAY THE TIDE WAS REVERSED. FLUSHED WITH THEIR VICTORIES AT FORT HENRY AND FORT DONELSON AND THE CAPTURE OF NASHVILLE AND THE WHOLE STATE OF TENNESSEE HAVING FALLEN INTO THEIR HANDS VICTORY WAS AGAIN TO PERCH UPON THEIR BANNERS FOR BUELL'S ARMY BY FORCED MARCHES HAD COME TO GRANT'S ASSISTANCE AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR. GUNBOATS AND TRANSPORTS WERE BUSILY CROSSING BUELL'S ARMY ALL OF SUNDAY NIGHT. WE COULD HEAR THEIR BOATS RINGING THEIR BELLS AND HEAR THE PUFF OF SMOKE AND STEAM FROM THEIR BOILERS. OUR REGIMENT WAS THE ADVANCE OUTPOST AND WE SAW THE SKIRMISH LINE OF THE FEDERALS ADVANCING AND THEN THEIR MAIN LINE AND THEN THEIR ARTILLERY. WE MADE A GOOD FIGHT ON MONDAY MORNING AND I WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE WHEN THE ORDER CAME FOR US TO RETREAT INSTEAD OF ADVANCE. BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTOMATON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW. SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO HISTORY. ONE INCIDENT I RECOLLECT VERY WELL. A YANKEE COLONEL RIDING A FINE GRAY MARE WAS SITTING ON HIS HORSE LOOKING AT OUR ADVANCE AS IF WE WERE ON REVIEW. W H RUSHED FORWARD AND GRABBED HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE TELLING HIM AT THE SAME TIME TO SURRENDER. ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEDERATE LINES. HIS PISTOL HAD MISSED ITS AIM. I HAVE HEARD HUNDREDS OF OLD SOLDIERS TELL OF THE AMOUNT OF GREENBACK MONEY THEY SAW AND PICKED UP ON THE BATTLEFIELD OF SHILOH BUT THEY THOUGHT IT VALUELESS AND DID NOT TROUBLE THEMSELVES WITH BRINGING IT OFF WITH THEM. HE BEGAN TO SEESAW THE MULE AND GRIT HIS TEETH AND FINALLY YELLED OUT IT ARN'T ME BOYS IT'S THIS BLARSTED OLD MULE WHOA WHOA. ON MONDAY MORNING I TOO CAPTURED ME A MULE. HE WAS NOT A FAST MULE AND I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE THOUGHT HE KNEW AS MUCH AS I DID. HE WAS WISE IN HIS OWN CONCEIT. HE HAD A PROPENSITY TO TAKE EVERY HOG PATH HE CAME TO. IF BLOOD MAKES SPEED I DO NOT SUPPOSE HE HAD A DROP OF ANY KIND IN HIM. IF I WANTED HIM TO GO ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD HE WAS SURE TO BE POSSESSED OF AN EQUAL DESIRE TO GO ON THE OTHER SIDE. I GOT A BIG HICKORY AND WOULD FRAIL HIM OVER THE HEAD AND HE WOULD ONLY SHAKE HIS HEAD AND FLOP HIS EARS AND SEEM TO SAY WELL NOW YOU THINK YOU ARE SMART DON'T YOU. I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MULE AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS NO. MULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TWISTER ON HIS NOSE. THE CAISSON OF A BATTERY WAS ABOUT TO CROSS. THE DRIVER SAID I'LL TAKE YOUR MULE OVER FOR YOU
