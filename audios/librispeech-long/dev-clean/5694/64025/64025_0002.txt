SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROPE TIED ONE END AROUND THE MULE'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CAISSON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIP UP. THE MULE WAS LOATH TO TAKE TO THE WATER. HE WAS NO BAPTIST AND DID NOT BELIEVE IN IMMERSION AND HAD HIS VIEWS ABOUT CROSSING STREAMS BUT THE ROPE BEGAN TO TIGHTEN THE MULE TO SQUEAL OUT HIS PROTESTATIONS AGAINST SUCH VILLAINOUS PROCEEDINGS. THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULE'S NO AND HE WAS FINALLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE TO CROSS THE CREEK. ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOLKS BUT YOU ARE A LEETLE TOO SMART. I GAVE IT UP THAT THAT MULE'S NO WAS A LITTLE STRONGER THAN MY DETERMINATION. HE SEEMED TO BE IN DEEP MEDITATION
