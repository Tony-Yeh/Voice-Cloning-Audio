SHILOH. THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE IN WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED. I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL OF WHAT COMMAND DISTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROES OF BLOOD AND WOUNDS OF SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANNON CAPTURED ET CETERA. CLOSE UP GUIDE RIGHT HALT FORWARD RIGHT OBLIQUE LEFT OBLIQUE HALT FORWARD GUIDE CENTER EYES RIGHT DRESS UP PROMPTLY IN THE REAR STEADY DOUBLE QUICK CHARGE BAYONETS FIRE AT WILL IS ABOUT ALL THAT A PRIVATE SOLDIER EVER KNOWS OF A BATTLE. BUT I NEVERTHELESS REMEMBER MANY THINGS THAT CAME UNDER MY OBSERVATION IN THIS BATTLE. OUR REGIMENT WAS THE ADVANCE GUARD ON SATURDAY EVENING AND DID A LITTLE SKIRMISHING BUT GENERAL GLADDEN'S BRIGADE PASSED US AND ASSUMED A POSITION IN OUR IMMEDIATE FRONT. ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHALMERS BRIGADE RELIEVED GLADDEN'S. AS GLADDEN RODE BY US A COURIER RODE UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS BUT I HEARD GLADDEN SAY TELL GENERAL BRAGG THAT I HAVE AS KEEN A SCENT FOR YANKEES AS GENERAL CHALMERS HAS. ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY. WE WERE SUPPORTING AN ALABAMA BRIGADE. THE AIR WAS FULL OF BALLS AND DEADLY MISSILES. THE LITTER CORPS WAS CARRYING OFF THE DYING AND WOUNDED. WE COULD HEAR THE SHOUT OF THE CHARGE AND THE INCESSANT ROAR OF THE GUNS THE RATTLE OF THE MUSKETRY AND KNEW THAT THE CONTENDING FORCES WERE ENGAGED IN A BREAST TO BREAST STRUGGLE. BUT CHEERING NEWS CONTINUED TO COME BACK. EVERY ONE WHO PASSED WOULD BE HAILED WITH WELL WHAT NEWS FROM THE FRONT. WELL BOYS WE ARE DRIVING EM. AS WE WERE ADVANCING TO THE ATTACK AND TO SUPPORT THE ALABAMA BRIGADE IN OUR FRONT AND WHICH HAD GIVEN WAY AND WERE STRICKEN WITH FEAR SOME OF THE BOYS OF OUR REGIMENT WOULD LAUGH AT THEM AND ASK WHAT THEY WERE RUNNING FOR AND WOULD COMMENCE TO SAY FLICKER FLICKER FLICKER. LIKE THE BIRD CALLED THE YELLOWHAMMER FLICKER FLICKER FLICKER. AS WE ADVANCED ON THE EDGE OF THE BATTLEFIELD WE SAW A BIG FAT COLONEL OF THE TWENTY THIRD TENNESSEE REGIMENT BADLY WOUNDED WHOSE NAME IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY WAS MATT MARTIN. HE SAID TO US GIVE EM GOSS BOYS. THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESSEE GIVE EM HAIL COLUMBIA. WE HALTED BUT A MOMENT AND SAID I COLONEL WHERE ARE YOU WOUNDED. HE ANSWERED IN A DEEP BASS VOICE MY SON I AM WOUNDED IN THE ARM IN THE LEG IN THE HEAD IN THE BODY AND IN ANOTHER PLACE WHICH I HAVE A DELICACY IN MENTIONING. THAT IS WHAT THE GALLANT OLD COLONEL SAID. ADVANCING A LITTLE FURTHER ON WE SAW GENERAL ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSON SURROUNDED BY HIS STAFF AND GOVERNOR HARRIS OF TENNESSEE. THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROOPS. ABOUT NOON A COURIER DASHED UP AND ORDERED US TO GO FORWARD AND SUPPORT GENERAL BRAGG'S CENTER. WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY. I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLEFIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANNON AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS. IT ALL SEEMED TO ME A DREAM I SEEMED TO BE IN A SORT OF HAZE WHEN SIZ SIZ SIZ THE MINNIE BALLS FROM THE YANKEE LINE BEGAN TO WHISTLE AROUND OUR EARS AND I THOUGHT OF THE IRISHMAN WHEN HE SAID SURE ENOUGH THOSE FELLOWS ARE SHOOTING BULLETS. DOWN WOULD DROP FIRST ONE FELLOW AND THEN ANOTHER EITHER KILLED OR WOUNDED WHEN WE WERE ORDERED TO CHARGE BAYONETS. I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THE ORDER TO CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY. I SHOUTED IT WAS FUN THEN. EVERYBODY LOOKED HAPPY WE WERE CROWDING THEM. ONE MORE CHARGE THEN THEIR LINES WAVER AND BREAK. THEY RETREAT IN WILD CONFUSION
