THE BREAST AND SLEEVE OF HIS COAT HAD BEEN TORN AWAY AND I COULD SEE THE FRAZZLED END OF HIS SHIRT SLEEVE WHICH APPEARED TO BE SUCKED INTO THE WOUND. I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD. FOR I COULD SEE HIS HEART THROB AND THE RESPIRATION OF HIS LUNGS. I WAS FILLED WITH WONDER AND HORROR AT THE SIGHT. HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN. I COULD TELL OF HUNDREDS OF SUCH INCIDENTS OF THE BATTLEFIELD BUT TELL ONLY THIS ONE BECAUSE I REMEMBER IT SO DISTINCTLY. ROBBING A DEAD YANKEE. IN PASSING OVER THE BATTLEFIELD I CAME ACROSS A DEAD YANKEE COLONEL. HE HAD ON THE FINEST CLOTHES I EVER SAW A RED SASH AND FINE SWORD. I PARTICULARLY NOTICED HIS BOOTS I NEEDED THEM AND HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO WEAR THEM OUT FOR HIM. BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES. I TOOK HOLD OF THE FOOT AND RAISED IT UP AND MADE ONE TRIAL AT THE BOOT TO GET IT OFF. HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED THAT FOOT QUICK. IT WAS MY FIRST AND LAST ATTEMPT TO ROB A DEAD YANKEE. AFTER THE BATTLE WAS OVER AT MURFREESBORO THAT NIGHT JOHN TUCKER AND MYSELF THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD INVESTIGATE THE CONTENTS OF A FINE BRICK MANSION IN OUR IMMEDIATE FRONT BUT BETWEEN OUR LINES AND THE YANKEES AND EVEN IN ADVANCE OF OUR VIDETS. BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US. OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK. WE RAN FORWARD EXPECTING THAT OUR MEN WOULD RECOGNIZE US BUT THEY OPENED FIRE UPON US I NEVER WAS AS BAD SCARED IN ALL MY WHOLE LIFE AND IF ANY POOR DEVIL EVER PRAYED WITH FERVENCY AND TRUE PIETY I DID IT ON THAT OCCASION. I THOUGHT I AM BETWEEN TWO FIRES
