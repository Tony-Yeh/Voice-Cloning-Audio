WE MARCHED PLUMB INTO THE YANKEE LINES WITH THEIR FLAGS FLYING. I CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THERE MIGHTY QUICK. THE YANKEES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT. WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK. WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILKERSON TURNPIKE. THE YANKEES WERE SHOOTING OUR MEN DOWN BY SCORES. A UNIVERSAL CRY WAS RAISED YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN. CEASE FIRING CEASE FIRING I HALLOOED IN FACT THE WHOLE SKIRMISH LINE HALLOOED AND KEPT ON TELLING THEM THAT THEY WERE YANKEES AND TO SHOOT BUT THE ORDER WAS TO CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN. CAPTAIN JAMES OF CHEATHAM'S STAFF WAS SENT FORWARD AND KILLED IN HIS OWN YARD. WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN. OAKLEY COLOR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEE LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW. THE LEADEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED. I SAW EITHER VICTORY OR DEATH WRITTEN ON HIS FACE. WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEATHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON. HE WAS LEADING THE CHARGE IN PERSON. I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE. HE DESERVES A WREATH OF IMMORTALITY AND A WARM PLACE IN EVERY SOUTHRON'S HEART FOR HIS BRAVE AND GLORIOUS EXAMPLE ON THAT BLOODY BATTLEFIELD OF MURFREESBORO. NOW ANOTHER FACT I WILL STATE AND THAT IS WHEN THE PRIVATE SOLDIER WAS ORDERED TO CHARGE AND CAPTURE THE TWELVE PIECES OF ARTILLERY HEAVILY SUPPORTED BY INFANTRY MANEY'S BRIGADE RAISED A WHOOP AND YELL AND SWOOPED DOWN ON THOSE YANKEES LIKE A WHIRL A GUST OF WOODPECKERS IN A HAIL STORM PAYING THE BLUE COATED RASCALS BACK WITH COMPOUND INTEREST FOR WHEN THEY DID COME EVERY MAN'S GUN WAS LOADED AND THEY MARCHED UPON THE BLAZING CREST IN SOLID FILE AND WHEN THEY DID FIRE THERE WAS A SUDDEN LULL IN THE STORM OF BATTLE BECAUSE THE YANKEES WERE NEARLY ALL KILLED. I CANNOT REMEMBER NOW OF EVER SEEING MORE DEAD MEN AND HORSES AND CAPTURED CANNON ALL JUMBLED TOGETHER THAN THAT SCENE OF BLOOD AND CARNAGE AND BATTLE ON THE WILKERSON TURNPIKE. THE GROUND WAS LITERALLY COVERED WITH BLUE COATS DEAD AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THERE WERE EIGHTY DEAD HORSES. BY THIS TIME OUR COMMAND HAD RE FORMED AND CHARGED THE BLAZING CREST THE SPECTACLE WAS GRAND. WITH CHEERS AND SHOUTS THEY CHARGED UP THE HILL SHOOTING DOWN AND BAYONETING THE FLYING CANNONEERS GENERAL CHEATHAM COLONEL FIELD AND JOE LEE CUTTING AND SLASHING WITH THEIR SWORDS THE VICTORY WAS COMPLETE. THE WHOLE LEFT WING OF THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS DRIVEN BACK FIVE MILES FROM THEIR ORIGINAL POSITION. THEIR DEAD AND WOUNDED WERE IN OUR LINES AND WE HAD CAPTURED MANY PIECES OF ARTILLERY SMALL ARMS AND PRISONERS. WHEN I WAS WOUNDED THE SHELL AND SHOT THAT STRUCK ME KNOCKED ME WINDING. I SAID O O I'M WOUNDED AND AT THE SAME TIME I GRABBED MY ARM. I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER. THE BRIGADE HAD FALLEN BACK ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS WHEN GENERAL CHEATHAM'S PRESENCE REASSURED THEM AND THEY SOON WERE IN LINE AND READY TO FOLLOW SO BRAVE AND GALLANT A LEADER AND HAD THAT ORDER OF CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN NOT BEEN GIVEN MANEY'S BRIGADE WOULD HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF CAPTURING EIGHTEEN PIECES OF ARTILLERY AND TEN THOUSAND PRISONERS. THIS I DO KNOW TO BE A FACT. AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG. I DO NOT KNOW TO WHAT REGIMENT HE BELONGED BUT I REMEMBER OF FIRST NOTICING THAT HIS LEFT ARM WAS ENTIRELY GONE. HIS FACE WAS AS WHITE AS A SHEET
