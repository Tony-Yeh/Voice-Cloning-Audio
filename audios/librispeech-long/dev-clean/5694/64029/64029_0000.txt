WE CAME FROM KNOXVILLE TO CHATTANOOGA AND SEEMED DESTINED TO MAKE A PERMANENT STAY HERE. WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN. FROM CHATTANOOGA BRAGG'S ARMY WENT TO MURFREESBORO. THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY. MARCHES AND BATTLES WERE THE ORDER OF THE DAY. OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MURFREESBORO. OUR ADVANCED OUTPOST WAS ESTABLISHED AT LAVERGNE. FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY. I WAS ON PICKET AT THE TIME THE ADVANCE WAS MADE BY ROSECRANS. AT THE TIME MENTIONED I WAS STANDING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS OFF THE ROAD THE MAIN BODY OF THE PICKETS BEING ON THE NASHVILLE AND MURFREESBORO TURNPIKE AND COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT HARDY MURFREE OF THE RUTHERFORD RIFLES. I HAD ORDERS TO ALLOW NO ONE TO PASS. IN FACT NO ONE WAS EXPECTED TO PASS AT THIS POINT BUT WHILE STANDING AT MY POST A HORSEMAN RODE UP BEHIND ME. I HALTED HIM AND TOLD HIM TO GO DOWN TO THE MAIN PICKET ON THE ROAD AND PASS BUT HE SEEMED SO SMILING THAT I THOUGHT HE KNEW ME OR HAD A GOOD JOKE TO TELL ME. HE ADVANCED UP AND PULLING A PIECE OF PAPER OUT OF HIS POCKET HANDED IT TO ME TO READ. IT WAS AN ORDER FROM GENERAL LEONIDAS POLK TO ALLOW THE BEARER TO PASS. I READ IT AND LOOKED UP TO HAND IT BACK TO HIM WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD A PISTOL COCKED AND LEVELED IN MY FACE AND SAYS HE DROP THAT GUN YOU ARE MY PRISONER. I DID NOT WISH TO SPEND MY WINTER IN A NORTHERN PRISON AND WHAT WAS WORSE I WOULD BE CALLED A DESERTER FROM MY POST OF DUTY. THE YANKEE PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF. I WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO LET THE SPY GO ON HIS WAY REJOICING FOR SUCH HE WAS BUT HE WANTED TO CAPTURE A REBEL. AND I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO THINK LIKEWISE. THERE I WAS A PRISONER SURE AND NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. HIS PISTOL WAS LEVELED AND I WAS ORDERED TO MARCH. I WAS AFRAID TO HALLOO TO THE RELIEF AND YOU MAY BE SURE I WAS IN A BAD FIX. FINALLY SAYS I LET'S PLAY QUITS. I THINK YOU ARE A SOLDIER YOU LOOK LIKE A GENTLEMAN. I AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME. YOU GO YOUR WAY AND LEAVE ME HERE IS IT A BARGAIN. SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SECESH ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY. I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND. MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT. I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN. HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM. HE PUT SPURS TO HIS HORSE BUT I PULLED DOWN ON HIM AND ALMOST TORE THE FORE SHOULDER OF HIS HORSE ENTIRELY OFF BUT I DID NOT CAPTURE THE SPY THOUGH I CAPTURED THE HORSE BRIDLE AND SADDLE. MAJOR ALLEN OF THE TWENTY SEVENTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT TOOK THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE AND GAVE ME THE BLANKET. BUT THEY CONTINUED TO ADVANCE UPON US WE FIRING AND RETREATING SLOWLY. WE HAD SEVERAL PRETTY SHARP BRUSHES WITH THEM THAT DAY. I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US. BATTLE OF MURFREESBORO. THE NEXT DAY THE YANKEES WERE FOUND OUT TO BE ADVANCING. SOON THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF OUR PICKET. WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT. LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONE'S RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE. BAD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS. JOHN BARLEYCORN WAS GENERAL IN CHIEF. OUR GENERALS AND COLONELS AND CAPTAINS HAD KISSED JOHN A LITTLE TOO OFTEN THEY COULDN'T SEE STRAIGHT. IT WAS SAID TO BE BUCKEYE WHISKY. THEY COULDN'T TELL OUR OWN MEN FROM YANKEES. THE PRIVATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE. BUT HERE THEY WERE THE YANKEES A BATTLE HAD TO BE FOUGHT. WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD I WAS ON THE SKIRMISH LINE
