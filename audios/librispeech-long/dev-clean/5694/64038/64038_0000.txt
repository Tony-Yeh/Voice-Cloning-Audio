ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE. AFTER REMAINING A GOOD LONG TIME AT JONESBORO THE NEWS CAME THAT WE WERE GOING TO FLANK ATLANTA. YANK SAYS WHAT YOU DOING JOHNNY. JOHNNY SAYS WE ARE FLANKING. YANK SAYS BULLY FOR YOU. WE PASSED AROUND ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATTAHOOCHEE AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSTON. IT TOOK US FOUR MONTHS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AND BUT LITTLE LONGER THAN AS MANY DAYS IN THE SECOND TO GET BACK TO DALTON OUR STARTING POINT. ON OUR WAY UP THERE THE YANKEE CAVALRY FOLLOWED US TO SEE HOW WE WERE GETTING ALONG WITH THE FLANKING BUSINESS. WE HAD PONTOONS MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CROSSING STREAMS. WHEN WE WOULD GET TO A STREAM THE PONTOONS WOULD BE THROWN ACROSS AND HOOD'S ARMY WOULD CROSS. YANK WOULD HALLOO OVER AND SAY WELL JOHNNY HAVE YOU GOT EVERYTHING ACROSS. YES WOULD BE THE ANSWER. WE PASSED ALL THOSE GLORIOUS BATTLEFIELDS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE CLASSIC IN HISTORY FREQUENTLY COMING ACROSS THE SKULL OF SOME POOR FELLOW SITTING ON TOP OF A STUMP GRINNING A GHASTLY SMILE ALSO THE BONES OF HORSES ALONG THE ROAD AND FENCES BURNED AND DESTROYED AND OCCASIONALLY THE CHARRED REMAINS OF A ONCE FINE DWELLING HOUSE. OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY. THE COUNTRY LOOKED LIKE IT DID AT FIRST. CITIZENS CAME OUT AND SEEMED GLAD TO SEE US AND WOULD DIVIDE THEIR ONIONS GARLIC AND LEEK WITH US. THE SOLDIERS WERE IN GOOD SPIRITS BUT IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF INNOCENCE AND PEACE NOT WAR AND VICTORY. WHERE THE RAILROADS WOULD CROSS A RIVER A BLOCK HOUSE HAD BEEN ERECTED AND THE BRIDGE WAS GUARDED BY A COMPANY OF FEDERALS. BUT WE ALWAYS FLANKED THESE LITTLE AFFAIRS. WE WANTED BIGGER AND BETTER MEAT. WE CAPTURE DALTON. WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAYBE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP. SO WE SENT FORWARD A PHYSICIAN WITH SOME WHITE BANDAGES TIED TO THE END OF A LONG POLE. HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS. WELL BOYS WE'VE COME FOR YOU. THE PLACE WAS GUARDED BY NEGRO TROOPS. WE MARCHED THE BLACK RASCALS OUT. THEY WERE MIGHTY GLAD TO SEE US AND WE WERE KINDLY DISPOSED TO THEM. A YANKEE ALWAYS SAYS NAGER. BUT THERE WERE SOME YANKEE SOLDIERS IN A BLOCK HOUSE AT RINGGOLD GAP WHO THOUGHT THEY WOULD ACT BIG. THEY SAID THAT SHERMAN HAD TOLD THEM NOT TO COME OUT OF THAT BLOCK HOUSE ANY HOW. BUT GENERAL WILLIAM B BATE BEGUN TO PERSUADE THE GENTLEMEN BY SENDING A FEW FOUR POUND PARROT FEELERS. AH THOSE FEELERS. THEY PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY. THEY PERSUADED EFFECTUALLY THOSE FEELERS DID. THE OLD PLACE LOOKED NATURAL LIKE ONLY IT SEEMED TO HAVE A SORT OF GRAVEYARD LONELINESS ABOUT IT. A MAN IN THE WELL. ON LEAVING DALTON AFTER A DAY'S MARCH WE HAD STOPPED FOR THE NIGHT. OUR GUNS WERE STACKED AND I STARTED OFF WITH A COMRADE TO GET SOME WOOD TO COOK SUPPER WITH. WE WERE WALKING ALONG HE A LITTLE IN THE REAR WHEN HE SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED. I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM. I CALLED AND CALLED BUT COULD GET NO ANSWER. GOING BACK TO CAMP I PROCURED A LIGHT AND AFTER WHOOPING AND HALLOOING FOR A LONG TIME I HEARD ANOTHER GROAN THIS TIME MUCH LOUDER THAN BEFORE. THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD. BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO FIND HIM SO I KEPT ON HALLOOING AND HE ANSWERING. I WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE THE VOICE APPEARED TO COME OUT OF THE EARTH. I WAS WALKING ALONG RATHER THOUGHTLESSLY AND CARELESSLY WHEN ONE INCH MORE AND I WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED ALSO. RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT. BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM
