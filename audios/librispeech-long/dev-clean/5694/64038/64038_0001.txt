THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT. HE WAS WORSE SCARED THAN HURT. TUSCUMBIA. WE ARRIVED AND REMAINED AT TUSCUMBIA SEVERAL DAYS AWAITING THE LAYING OF THE PONTOONS ACROSS THE TENNESSEE RIVER AT FLORENCE ALABAMA AND THEN WE ALL CROSSED OVER. WHILE AT TUSCUMBIA JOHN BRANCH AND I SAW A NICE SWEET POTATO PATCH THAT LOOKED VERY TEMPTING TO A HUNGRY REBEL. WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR. WE JUMPED OVER THE FENCE AND COMMENCED GRABBLING FOR THE SWEET POTATOES. I LOOKED AROUND AND THERE WAS A SOLDIER GUARD. WE BROKE AND RUN LIKE QUARTER HORSES AND THE GUARD PULLED DOWN ON US JUST AS WE JUMPED THE FENCE. I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE. WE MARCHED FROM DECATUR TO FLORENCE. HERE THE PONTOON BRIDGES WERE NICELY AND BEAUTIFULLY STRETCHED ACROSS THE RIVER. WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE OF TENNESSEE RIVER. IN DRIVING A GREAT HERD OF CATTLE ACROSS THE PONTOON THE FRONT ONE GOT STUBBORN AND THE OTHERS CROWDING UP ALL IN ONE BULK BROKE THE LINE THAT HELD THE PONTOON AND DROWNED MANY OF THE DROVE. WE HAD BEEF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT. AND NIGHTLY WE PITCH OUR MOVING TENT A DAY'S MARCH NEARER HOME. HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES. THE COLD NOVEMBER WINDS COMING OFF THE MOUNTAINS OF THE NORTHWEST WERE BLOWING RIGHT IN OUR FACES AND NEARLY CUTTING US IN TWO. WE WERE INURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE IN EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE IN EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY IN EVERY DEFEAT. WE HAD FOLLOWED THE SUCCESSES AND REVERSES OF THE FLAG OF THE LOST CAUSE THROUGH ALL THESE YEARS OF BLOOD AND STRIFE. I WAS SIMPLY ONE OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN THE SAME FIX. THE TALE IS THE SAME THAT EVERY SOLDIER WOULD TELL EXCEPT JIM WHITLER. JIM HAD DODGED ABOUT AND HAD ESCAPED BEING CONSCRIPTED UNTIL HOOD'S RAID HE CALLED IT. HOOD'S ARMY WAS TAKING UP EVERY ABLE BODIED MAN AND CONSCRIPTING HIM INTO THE ARMY. JIM WHITLER HAD GOT A POSITION AS OVER SEER ON A LARGE PLANTATION AND HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED NEGROES UNDER HIS SURVEILLANCE. THE ARMY HAD BEEN PASSING A GIVEN POINT AND JIM WAS SITTING QUIETLY ON THE FENCE LOOKING AT THE SOLDIERS. THE CONSCRIPTING SQUAD NABBED HIM. JIM TRIED TO BEG OFF BUT ALL ENTREATY WAS IN VAIN. HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO. BUT AFTER AWHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN AY GANNY THE LAW. YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW. HE DIDN'T KNOW B FROM A BULL'S FOOT IN THE SPELLING BOOK BUT HE SAID THE LAW. NOW WHEN ANYONE SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT THE LAW EVERY ONE STOPS TO LISTEN. THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST. JIM'S SPIRITS SANK HIS HOPES VANISHED INTO AIR. JIM WAS SOON IN LINE AND WAS TRAMPING TO THE MUSIC OF THE MARCH. HE STAYED WITH THE COMPANY TWO DAYS. THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURFREESBORO PIKE. A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT. HE ADVANCED BRAVELY INTO BATTLE. THE MINNIE BALLS BEGAN TO WHISTLE AROUND HIS EARS THE REGIMENT WAS ORDERED TO FIRE. HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
