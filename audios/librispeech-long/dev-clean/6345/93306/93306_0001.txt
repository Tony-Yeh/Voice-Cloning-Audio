LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT IS ALL NONSENSE WE KNOW WE WHO HAVE COME TO FORTY YEAR BUT AT TWENTY ONE ONE DOES NOT SOMEHOW RECOGNISE IT FOR THE NONSENSE IT IS. BUT DON'T YOU KNOW ANYONE IN LONDON HE ASKED IN A SENSIBLE POSTSCRIPT. THERE'S NO ONE I COULD LET KNOW. YOU SEE PAPA'S SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TO TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED. AMERICAN HEIRESSES ARE EXPECTED TO MARRY ENGLISH DUKES HE SAID WITH A DISTINCT PHYSICAL PAIN AT HIS HEART. IT WASN'T I WHO SAID THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT'S SO ANYHOW AND THEN SHE SIGHED. SO IT'S YOUR DESTINY TO MARRY A DUKE IS IT THE YOUNG MAN SPOKE SLOWLY. ALL THE SAME HE ADDED IRRELEVANTLY YOU SHALL HAVE THE LATCH KEY. YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY. THE LADY AND THE GUITAR CERTAINLY PASSED THE NIGHT AT HILL VIEW VILLA BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANGRY AND VERY FRIGHTENED CAME UP WITH HIM AT ABOUT NOON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS USUAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHARWOMAN. AN ADVENTURESS I TOLD YOU SO. THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THANK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BANJO GIRL HAS TAKEN A PAIR OF YOUR SISTER'S SILK STOCKINGS AND THOSE NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE SILVER BUCKLES AND SHE'S LEFT THESE. SHE HELD OUT A PAIR OF LITTLE PATENT LEATHER SHOES VERY WORN AND DUSTY THE SLENDER SILKEN WEB OF A BLACK STOCKING BROWN WITH DUST HUNG FROM HER HAND HE ANSWERED NOTHING. SHE SPENT THE REST OF THAT DAY IN SEARCHING THE HOUSE FOR FURTHER LOSSES BUT ALL THINGS WERE IN THEIR PLACE EXCEPT THE SILVER HANDLED BUTTON HOOK AND THAT AS EVEN HIS SISTER OWNED HAD BEEN MISSING FOR MONTHS. YET HIS FAMILY WOULD NEVER LEAVE HIM TO KEEP HOUSE ALONE AGAIN THEY SAID HE IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED AND PERHAPS THEY ARE RIGHT. THE HALF DOZEN PAIRS OF EMBROIDERED SILK STOCKINGS AND THE DAINTY FRENCH SILVER BUCKLED SHOES WHICH ARRIVED A MONTH LATER ADDRESSED TO MISS HILL VIEW VILLA ONLY CONFIRMED THEIR DISTRUST. HE MUST HAVE HAD THEM SENT THAT TAMBOURINE GIRL COULD NEVER HAVE AFFORDED THESE WHY THEY WERE PURE SILK AND THE QUALITY. IT WAS PLAIN THAT HIS CASTANET GIRL HIS MOTHER AND SISTER TOOK A PLEASURE IN CREDITING HER DAILY WITH SOME FRESH AND UNPLEASING INSTRUMENT COULD HAVE HAD NEITHER TASTE MONEY NOR HONESTY TO SUCH A POINT AS THIS
