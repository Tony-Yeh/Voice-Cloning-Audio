THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED INTERMEZZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BARREL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAILY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUNES OF ITS REPERTORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSEMAID AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR. THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAX CANDLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICKS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING AND THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE DAY'S APPOINTED TORTURE. THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THEN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVEL. HE THREW BACK THE CURTAIN AND LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW. HERE HE CALLED TO THE FIGURE THAT MOVED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE GATE. SHE TURNED QUICKLY AND CAME BACK TWO STEPS. SHE WORE THE DRESS OF A CONTADINA A VERY SMART DRESS INDEED AND HER HANDS LOOKED SMALL AND WHITE. WON'T YOU SING AGAIN HE ASKED. SHE HESITATED THEN STRUCK A CHORD OR TWO AND BEGAN ANOTHER OF THOSE LITTLE TUNEFUL ITALIAN SONGS ALL STARS AND FLOWERS AND HEARTS OF GOLD. AND AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIET PLEASURE. NEVER HAD ANY ACT SEEMED SO IMPOSSIBLE. AREN'T YOU TIRED HE SAID WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND REST. THERE IS A SEAT IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HESITATED. THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE LAUREL BUSHES. HE WAS ALONE IN THE HOUSE HIS PEOPLE AND THE SERVANTS WERE IN THE COUNTRY THE WOMAN WHO CAME TO DO FOR HIM HAD LEFT FOR THE NIGHT. HE WENT INTO THE DINING ROOM DARK WITH MAHOGANY AND DAMASK FOUND WINE AND CAKE IN THE SIDEBOARD CUPBOARD PUT THEM ON A TRAY AND TOOK THEM OUT THROUGH THE GARDEN DOOR AND ROUND TO THE CORNER WHERE ALMOST SHELTERED BY LABURNUMS AND HAWTHORNS FROM THE VIEW OF THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR THE SINGER AND HER GUITAR RESTED ON THE IRON SEAT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND A SINGLE WORD YOU SAY. IT WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT WITH THEM. LET ME GO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AM SURE YOU MEANT TO BE KIND AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN. LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE TIRED OUT AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT. DO DRINK THIS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU. SHE DRANK OBEDIENTLY THEN SHE SAID I HAVE NOT HAD ANYTHING TO EAT SINCE LAST NIGHT. HE HURRIEDLY CUT CAKE AND PRESSED IT UPON HER. HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM. HIS VOICE WAS KINDER THAN HE MEANT IT TO BE HER EYES FILLED AGAIN WITH TEARS. OH I NEVER KNEW BEFORE WHAT DEVILS PEOPLE ARE TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE POOR. IS IT ONLY THAT YOU'RE POOR WHY THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE LAUGHED. I'M NOT POOR NOT REALLY. WHAT IS IT THEN YOU'VE QUARRELLED WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND AH TELL ME AND LET ME TRY TO HELP YOU. YOU ARE KIND BUT WELL THEN IT'S LIKE THIS. BUT SURELY HE DIDN'T LEAVE YOU WITHOUT MONEY. HER LITTLE FOOT TAPPED THE GRAVEL IMPATIENTLY. I'M COMING TO THAT SHE SAID OF COURSE HE DIDN'T. HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATRE MY MAID A HORRID FRENCH THING WE GOT IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TRUNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAID THE BILL AND WENT. SHE STOPPED SHORT AND LOOKED AT HIM THROUGH THE DUSK. HE DID NOT SPEAK BUT WHATEVER SHE SAW IN HIS FACE IT SATISFIED HER. SHE SAID AGAIN YOU ARE KIND. GO ON HE SAID TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT. WELL THEN I WENT INTO LODGINGS THAT WICKED WOMAN HAD LEFT ME ONE STREET SUIT AND TO DAY THEY TURNED ME OUT BECAUSE MY MONEY WAS ALL GONE. I HAD A LITTLE MONEY IN MY PURSE AND THIS DRESS HAD BEEN ORDERED FOR A FANCY BALL IT IS SMART ISN'T IT AND IT CAME AFTER THAT WRETCH HAD GONE AND THE GUITAR TOO AND I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE A LITTLE MONEY I REALLY CAN SING THOUGH YOU MIGHTN'T THINK IT. AND I'VE BEEN AT IT SINCE FIVE O'CLOCK AND I'VE ONLY GOT ONE SHILLING AND SEVEN PENCE. LET ME THINK HE SAID OH HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU HAPPENED TO COME THIS WAY. I SHALL LOCK UP ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LATCH KEY AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE. I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT TRAIN AND BRING MY MOTHER UP TO MORROW THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
