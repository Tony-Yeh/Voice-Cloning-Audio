THITHER SHE WENT WALKING THE ONLY LIVING THING CROSSING STRANGE SHADOWS FROM THE MOON. AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TOMBS. TERROR AND A DISMAY INDESCRIBABLE SEIZED HER SHE TURNED AND FLED BACK TO THE COMPANY OF HER KIND. BUT FOR A LONG TIME SHE SOUGHT THE HOUSE IN VAIN SHE COULD NOT REACH IT THE AVENUE SEEMED INTERMINABLE TO HER FEET RETURNING. AT LAST SHE WAS AGAIN UPON THE LAWN BUT NEITHER MAN NOR WOMAN WAS THERE AND IN THE HOUSE ONLY A LIGHT HERE AND THERE WAS BURNING EVERY GUEST WAS GONE. SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEEDED HER. SHE WAS OUT OF PLACE AND MUCH UNWELCOME. SHE HASTENED TO THE DOOR OF ENTRANCE FOR EVERY MOMENT THERE WAS A MISERY SHE REACHED THE HALL A STRANGE SHADOWY PORTER OPENED TO HER AND SHE STEPPED OUT INTO A WIDE STREET. THAT TOO WAS SILENT. NO CARRIAGE ROLLED ALONG THE CENTER NO FOOTFARER WALKED ON THE SIDE. NOT A LIGHT SHONE FROM WINDOW OR DOOR SAVE WHAT THEY GAVE BACK OF THE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON. SHE WAS LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN ETERNAL LOSS. SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO NOWHERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL. BUT LIVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEET. SHE SAT DOWN UPON A STONE BETWEEN THE WIDE STREET AND THE WIDE PAVEMENT AND SAW THE MOON SHINING GRAY UPON THE STONE HOUSES IT WAS ALL DEADNESS. SHE HAD LOST HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM. BUT NOT A THROB WENT THROUGH HER HEART. HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREETING. WHY SHOULD I HEED HIM SHE SAID TO HERSELF HE IS DEAD. IT IS NOTHING I AM NOTHING I AM LOST. EVERYTHING IS AN EMPTY DREAM OF LOSS. I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO WAKING. IF THERE WERE SURELY THE SIGHT OF HIM WOULD GIVE ME SOME SHIMMER OF DELIGHT. THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICKER DREAM AND THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE MORE SHADOWY. AND THE FORM STILL STANDING BY HER SHE FELT IT WAS AGES AWAY SHE WAS DIVIDED FROM IT BY A GULF OF VERY NOTHINGNESS. HER ONLY LIFE WAS THAT SHE WAS LOST. HER WHOLE CONSCIOUSNESS WAS MEREST ALL BUT ABSTRACT LOSS. THEN CAME THE FORM OF HER MOTHER AND BENT OVER THAT OF HER BROTHER FROM BEHIND. ANOTHER GHOST OF A GHOST ANOTHER SHADOW OF A PHANTOM SHE SAID TO HERSELF SHE IS NOTHING TO ME. IF I SPEAK TO HER SHE IS NOT THERE. SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A MIST A FUME FROM MY OWN BRAIN. OH COLD CREATURES YE ARE NOT WHAT YE SEEM AND I WILL NONE OF YOU. WITH THAT CAME HER FATHER AND STOOD BESIDE THE OTHERS GAZING UPON HER WITH STILL COLD EYES EXPRESSING ONLY A PALE QUIET. SHE BOWED HER FACE ON HER HANDS AND WOULD NOT REGARD HIM. EVEN IF HE WERE ALIVE HER HEART WAS PAST BEING MOVED IT WAS SETTLED INTO STONE. THE UNIVERSE WAS SUNK IN ONE OF THE DREAMS THAT HAUNT THE SLEEP OF DEATH AND IF THESE WERE GHOSTS AT ALL THEY WERE GHOSTS WALKING IN THEIR SLEEP. BUT THE DEAD ONE OF THEM SEIZED ONE OF HER HANDS AND ANOTHER THE OTHER. THEY RAISED HER TO HER FEET AND LED HER ALONG AND HER BROTHER WALKED BEFORE. THUS WAS SHE BORNE AWAY CAPTIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILLING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS. THROUGH THE MOONLIGHT THEY LED HER FROM THE CITY AND OVER FIELDS AND THROUGH VALLEYS AND ACROSS RIVERS AND SEAS A LONG JOURNEY NOR DID SHE GROW WEARY FOR THERE WAS NOT LIFE ENOUGH IN HER TO BE MADE WEARY. THE DEAD NEVER SPOKE TO HER AND SHE NEVER SPOKE TO THEM
