THAT NIGHT AND EVERY NIGHT UNTIL THE DUST WAS LAID TO THE DUST MARY SLEPT WELL AND THROUGH THE DAYS SHE HAD GREAT COMPOSURE BUT WHEN THE FUNERAL WAS OVER CAME A COLLAPSE AND A CHANGE. THE MOMENT IT BECAME NECESSARY TO LOOK ON THE WORLD AS UNCHANGED AND RESUME FORMER RELATIONS WITH IT THEN FIRST A FULLER SENSE OF HER LONELY DESOLATION DECLARED ITSELF. WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEENIE AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB. THAT NIGHT WAS THE FIRST HERALD OF THE COMING WINTER AND BLEW A COLD BLAST FROM HIS HORN. ALL DAY THE WIND HAD BEEN OUT. AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE AND THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IT FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE. THE SMELL OF THE LINEN OF THE BLUE CLOTH AND OF THE BROWN PAPER THINGS NO LONGER TO BE HANDLED BY THOSE TENDER FAITHFUL HANDS WAS DISMAL AND STRANGE AND HAUNTED HER LIKE THINGS THAT INTRUDED THINGS WHICH SHE HAD DONE WITH AND WHICH YET WOULD NOT GO AWAY. EVERYTHING HAD GONE DEAD AS IT SEEMED HAD EXHALED THE SOUL OF IT AND RETAINED BUT THE ODOR OF ITS MORTALITY. IF FOR A MOMENT A THING LOOKED THE SAME AS BEFORE SHE WONDERED VAGUELY UNCONSCIOUSLY HOW IT COULD BE. THE PASSAGES THROUGH THE MERCHANDISE LEFT ONLY WIDE ENOUGH FOR ONE SEEMED LIKE THOSE SHE HAD READ OF IN EGYPTIAN TOMBS AND PYRAMIDS A SARCOPHAGUS OUGHT TO BE WAITING IN HER CHAMBER. WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BEENIE UNDESIRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL. SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWOOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE. NOW AND THEN WOULD COME A GREATER GUST AND RATTLE THE WINDOW AS IF IN FIERCE ANGER AT ITS EXCLUSION THEN GO SHRIEKING AND WAILING THROUGH THE DARK HEAVEN. MECHANICALLY SHE TOOK HER NEW TESTAMENT AND SEATING HERSELF IN A LOW CHAIR BY THE FIRE TRIED TO READ BUT SHE COULD NOT FIX HER THOUGHTS OR GET THE MEANING OF A SENTENCE WHEN SHE HAD READ IT THERE IT LAY LOOKING AT HER JUST THE SAME LIKE AN UNANSWERED RIDDLE. THE REGION OF THE SENSES IS THE UNBELIEVING PART OF THE HUMAN SOUL AND OUT OF THAT NOW BEGAN TO RISE FUMES OF DOUBT AND QUESTION INTO MARY'S HEART AND BRAIN DEATH WAS A FACT. THE LOSS THE EVANISHMENT THE CEASING WERE INCONTROVERTIBLE THE ONLY INCONTROVERTIBLE THINGS SHE WAS SURE OF THEM COULD SHE BE SURE OF ANYTHING ELSE HOW COULD SHE. SHE HAD NOT SEEN CHRIST RISE SHE HAD NEVER LOOKED UPON ONE OF THE DEAD NEVER HEARD A VOICE FROM THE OTHER BANK HAD RECEIVED NO CERTAIN TESTIMONY. AT LAST SHE FELL ASLEEP AND IN A MOMENT WAS DREAMING DILIGENTLY. THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY. SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND. IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLORS AND ODORS. THE MOON WAS SHINING AND THE ROSES WERE IN PALE BLOOM. BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND. EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE CAME ON A LITTLE GROUP OR MET A PARTY OF THE GUESTS AS SHE WALKED BUT NONE SPOKE TO HER OR SEEMED TO SEE HER AND SHE SPOKE TO NONE. SHE FOUND HERSELF AT LENGTH IN AN AVENUE OF DARK TREES THE END OF WHICH WAS FAR OFF
