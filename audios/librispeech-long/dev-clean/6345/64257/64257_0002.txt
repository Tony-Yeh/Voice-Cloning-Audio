SOMETIMES IT SEEMED AS IF THEY SPOKE TO EACH OTHER BUT IF IT WERE SO IT CONCERNED SOME SHADOWY MATTER NO MORE TO HER THAN THE TALK OF GRASSHOPPERS IN THE FIELD OR OF BEETLES THAT WEAVE THEIR MUCH INVOLVED DANCES ON THE FACE OF THE POOL. THEY CAME AT LENGTH TO A GREAT MOUNTAIN AND AS THEY WERE GOING UP THE MOUNTAIN LIGHT BEGAN TO GROW AS IF THE SUN WERE BEGINNING TO RISE BUT SHE CARED AS LITTLE FOR THE SUN THAT WAS TO LIGHT THE DAY AS FOR THE MOON THAT HAD LIGHTED THE NIGHT AND CLOSED HER EYES THAT SHE MIGHT COVER HER SOUL WITH HER EYELIDS. OF A SUDDEN A GREAT SPLENDOR BURST UPON HER AND THROUGH HER EYELIDS SHE WAS STRUCK BLIND BLIND WITH LIGHT AND NOT WITH DARKNESS FOR ALL WAS RADIANCE ABOUT HER. SHE WAS LIKE A FISH IN A SEA OF LIGHT. BUT SHE NEITHER LOVED THE LIGHT NOR MOURNED THE SHADOW. THEN WERE HER EARS INVADED WITH A CONFUSED MURMUR AS OF THE MINGLING OF ALL SWEET SOUNDS OF THE EARTH OF WIND AND WATER OF BIRD AND VOICE OF STRING AND METAL ALL AFAR AND INDISTINCT. SUDDENLY SHE WAS TAKEN BETWEEN TWO HANDS AND LIFTED AND SEATED UPON KNEES LIKE A CHILD AND SHE FELT THAT SOME ONE WAS LOOKING AT HER. THEN CAME A VOICE ONE THAT SHE NEVER HEARD BEFORE YET WITH WHICH SHE WAS AS FAMILIAR AS WITH THE SOUND OF THE BLOWING WIND. AND THE VOICE SAID POOR CHILD. SOMETHING HAS CLOSED THE VALVE BETWEEN HER HEART AND MINE. WITH THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
