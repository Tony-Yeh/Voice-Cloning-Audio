THE UNFAITHFUL LOVER. SHE WAS GOING TO MEET HER LOVER. AND THE FACT THAT SHE WAS TO MEET HIM AT CANNON STREET STATION WOULD ALMOST SHE FEARED MAKE THE MEETING ITSELF BANAL SORDID. SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO MEET HIM IN SOME GREEN COOL ORCHARD WHERE DAFFODILS SWUNG IN THE LONG GRASS AND PRIMROSES STOOD ON FRAIL STIFF LITTLE PINK STALKS IN THE WET SCENTED MOSS OF THE HEDGEROW. THE TIME SHOULD HAVE BEEN MAY. SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POEM A LYRIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS. HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUEBELLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE IN MAIDENLY DEFENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS. YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRYST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEEKLY JOURNALS. SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER READING AND HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE. NOW THAT SHE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN SHE COULD NEVER BE HAPPY LONG BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO WATCH HER HEART'S HAPPINESS AND IT USED TO STOP THEN JUST AS THE TEARS HAD. HE HAD ASKED HER TO MEET HIM AT CANNON STREET HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO HER AND AT HOME IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET A QUIET HALF HOUR BECAUSE OF HER LITTLE SISTERS. AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY. SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE DINGY DUSTY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCUPIED TRAVELLERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER. THE SETTING OF THE SCENE SEEMED TO HER ALL IMPORTANT. HER DRESS WAS BROWN HER JACKET BLACK AND HER HAT WAS HOME TRIMMED. YET SHE LOOKED ENTRANCINGLY PRETTY TO HIM AS HE CAME THROUGH THE HEAVY SWING DOORS. HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE KNOWN HER IN GREEN AND WHITE MUSLIN AND AN ORCHARD FOR THEIR LOVE HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED IN TOWN HIGHBURY NEW PARK TO BE EXACT. HE CAME TOWARDS HER HE WAS FIVE MINUTES LATE. SHE HAD GROWN ANXIOUS AS THE ONE WHO WAITS ALWAYS DOES AND SHE WAS EXTREMELY GLAD TO SEE HIM BUT SHE KNEW THAT A LATE LOVER SHOULD BE TREATED WITH A PROVOKING COLDNESS ONE CAN RELENT PRETTILY LATER ON SO SHE GAVE HIM A LIMP HAND AND NO GREETING. LET'S GO OUT HE SAID SHALL WE WALK ALONG THE EMBANKMENT OR GO SOMEWHERE ON THE UNDERGROUND. IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMBANKMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE. HE OUGHT TO INSIST ON THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE HE PROBABLY WOULD SO SHE SAID. OH THE EMBANKMENT PLEASE AND FELT A STING OF ANNOYANCE AND DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN HE ACQUIESCED. THEY DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN TILL THEY HAD GONE THROUGH THE LITTLE BACK STREETS PAST THE POLICE STATION AND THE MUSTARD FACTORY AND WERE ON THE BROAD PAVEMENT OF QUEEN VICTORIA STREET. HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD OFFERED NO EXCUSE NO EXPLANATION. SHE HAD DONE THE PROPER THING SHE HAD AWAITED THESE WITH DIGNIFIED RESERVE AND NOW SHE WAS INVOLVED IN THE MESHES OF A SILENCE THAT SHE COULD NOT BREAK. HOW EASY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE ORCHARD. THEN HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO SAY SOMETHING. BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT. AND HOW COMMON AND MEAN THAT WOULD BE COMPARED WITH THE BLOSSOMING BOUGH AND BESIDES THE SHOPS THEY WERE PASSING HAD NOTHING IN THE WINDOWS EXCEPT CHEAP PASTRY AND MODELS OF STEAM ENGINES. WHY ON EARTH DIDN'T HE SPEAK HE HAD NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS BEFORE. HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WAS TRYING TO GET ITSELF SAID. THE KEEN WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET. HER HANDS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COLD. HOW WARM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE ORCHARD. I'M FREEZING SHE SAID SUDDENLY LET'S GO AND HAVE SOME TEA. OF COURSE IF YOU LIKE HE SAID UNCOMFORTABLY YET SHE COULD SEE HE WAS GLAD THAT SHE HAD BROKEN THAT DESOLATE SILENCE. SEATED AT A MARBLE TABLE THE PLACE WAS NEARLY EMPTY SHE FURTIVELY WATCHED HIS FACE IN THE GLASS AND WHAT SHE SAW THERE THRILLED HER. SOME GREAT SORROW HAD COME TO HIM. SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOWN HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK HOUR. WELL IT WAS NOT TOO LATE. SHE COULD BEGIN NOW BUT HOW
