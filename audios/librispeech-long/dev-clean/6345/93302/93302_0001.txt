HE HAD ORDERED THE TEA AND HER QUESTION WAS STILL UNANSWERED YET SHE MUST SPEAK. WHEN SHE DID HER WORDS DID NOT FIT THE MOUTH OF THE GIRL IN THE ORCHARD BUT THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MAY THERE AND THIS WAS JANUARY. SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY COLD IT IS. YES ISN'T IT HE SAID. THE WAITRESS BROUGHT THE TWO THICK CUPS OF TEA AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH A TEPID CURIOSITY. AS SOON AS THE TWO WERE ALONE AGAIN HE LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE MARBLE AND SPOKE. THIS PREAMBLE SENT A SHIVER OF DREAD DOWN HER SPINE. WHAT HAD HE DONE A MURDER A BANK ROBBERY MARRIED SOMEONE ELSE. WELL I WENT TO THE SIMPSONS DANCE ON TUESDAY OH WHY WEREN'T YOU THERE ETHEL AND THERE WAS A GIRL IN PINK AND I DANCED THREE OR FOUR TIMES WITH HER SHE WAS RATHER LIKE YOU SIDE FACE AND THEN AFTER SUPPER IN THE CONSERVATORY I I TALKED NONSENSE BUT ONLY A VERY LITTLE DEAR AND SHE KEPT LOOKING AT ME SO AS IF SHE EXPECTED ME TO TO AND SO I KISSED HER. AND YESTERDAY I HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING. OH ETHEL DO TRY TO FORGIVE ME I HAVEN'T ANSWERED HER LETTER. WELL SHE SAID. A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER SO THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS. WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FAILED TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY. HE HIMSELF WAS EVIDENTLY A PREY TO THE MOST RENDING REMORSE. HE HAD TOLD HER OF THE THING AS ONE TELLS OF A CRIME. AS THE CONFESSION OF A CRIME SHE MUST RECEIVE IT. FOLLOWING THE TINGLE OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICKENING PINCH OF JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER. I DON'T WONDER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS AN IDIOT TO BELIEVE YOU DID. YOU KNOW I DO HE SAID IT WAS HATEFUL OF ME BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT. THOSE FOUR TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST. COULDN'T HELP IT THEN HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU. EVEN IF WE WERE MARRIED I COULD NEVER BE SURE YOU WEREN'T KISSING SOME HORRID GIRL OR OTHER. HE COULD NOT SAY AND SO I AM ON THE WHOLE WHICH WAS WHAT HE THOUGHT. HER TEARS WERE FALLING HOT AND FAST BETWEEN FACE AND VEIL FOR SHE HAD TALKED TILL SHE WAS VERY SORRY INDEED FOR HERSELF. FORGIVE ME DEAR HE SAID THEN SHE ROSE TO THE OCCASION. NEVER SHE SAID HER EYES FLASHING THROUGH HER TEARS. YOU'VE DECEIVED ME ONCE YOU'D DO IT AGAIN NO IT'S ALL OVER YOU'VE BROKEN MY HEART AND DESTROYED MY FAITH IN HUMAN NATURE. I HOPE I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN. DO YOU THINK I'M NOT SORRY NOW. SHE WISHED THAT THEY WERE AT HOME AND NOT IN THIS HORRIBLE TEA SHOP UNDER THE CURIOUS EYES OF THE WAITRESSES. HE WOULD COME TO MORROW HOWEVER AND THEN AT PRESENT THE THING TO COMPASS WAS A DIGNIFIED PARTING. GOOD BYE SHE SAID I'M GOING HOME AND IT'S GOOD BYE FOR EVER. NO IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOTH OF US. THERE'S NO MORE TO BE SAID YOU'VE BETRAYED ME. I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HOME AND GLOAT OVER IT ALL. AND THAT POOR GIRL YOU'VE BROKEN HER HEART TOO. THIS REALLY WAS A MASTER STROKE OF NOBILITY. HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO YOU MEAN IT. HE SAID AND HIS TONE SHOULD HAVE WARNED HER. ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OVER FOR A THING LIKE THIS. YES GOOD BYE HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY. AND HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT. AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMEDY THAT ERROR. HE CHECKED THE SILLY IMPULSE. WHAT WAS TEA AND THE PRICE OF TEA IN THIS CATACLYSMIC OVERTHROWING OF THE UNIVERSE. SO SHE WAITED FOR HIM IN VAIN AND AT LAST PAID FOR THE TEA HERSELF AND WENT HOME TO WAIT THERE AND THERE TOO IN VAIN FOR HE NEVER CAME BACK TO HER. THEREFORE HE NEVER DREAMING THAT THE LITERARY SENSE HAD INSPIRED HER TOO PERCEIVED THAT TO THE JILTED LOVER TWO COURSES ONLY ARE POSSIBLE SUICIDE OR THE FRONT. SO HE ENLISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
