HE WALKED TOWARD THE CASTLE WHICH APPEARED NOW AT THE END OF A LONG AVENUE BUT WHEN HE TURNED TO LOOK FOR HIS FOLLOWERS NOT ONE WAS TO BE SEEN THE WOODS HAD CLOSED INSTANTLY UPON HIM AS HE HAD PASSED THROUGH. HE WAS ENTIRELY ALONE AND UTTER SILENCE WAS ABOUT HIM. HE ENTERED A LARGE FORECOURT AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE. ON EVERY SIDE WERE STRETCHED THE BODIES OF MEN AND ANIMALS APPARENTLY LIFELESS. BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT. THE MEN HAD PLAINLY FALLEN ASLEEP. HIS STEPS RESOUNDED AS HE PASSED OVER THE MARBLE PAVEMENT AND UP THE MARBLE STAIRCASE. HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP. HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS OR STANDING. HE ENTERED A CHAMBER COVERED WITH GOLD AND SAW ON A BED THE CURTAINS OF WHICH WERE DRAWN THE MOST LOVELY SIGHT HE HAD EVER LOOKED UPON A PRINCESS WHO APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN AND SO FAIR THAT SHE SEEMED TO BELONG TO ANOTHER WORLD. HE DREW NEAR TREMBLING AND WONDERING AND KNELT BESIDE HER. HER HAND LAY UPON HER BREAST AND HE TOUCHED HIS LIPS TO IT. AT THAT MOMENT THE ENCHANTMENT BEING ENDED THE PRINCESS AWOKE AND LOOKING DROWSILY AND TENDERLY AT THE YOUNG MAN SAID. HAVE YOU COME MY PRINCE. I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR YOU. THE PRINCE WAS OVERJOYED AT THE WORDS AND AT THE TENDER VOICE AND LOOK AND SCARCELY KNEW HOW TO SPEAK. BUT HE MANAGED TO ASSURE HER OF HIS LOVE AND THEY SOON FORGOT ALL ELSE AS THEY TALKED AND TALKED. THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY. MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN WAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY. THE LADY IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER. THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDOUR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT. THEY PASSED INTO A HALL OF MIRRORS WHERE THEY SUPPED ATTENDED BY THE OFFICERS OF THE PRINCESS. THE VIOLINS AND HAUT BOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMONER MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS IN THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE. WHEN THEY LEFT THE CASTLE THE NEXT DAY TO RETURN TO THE PRINCE'S HOME THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY ALL THE RETINUE OF THE PRINCESS. THEY MARCHED DOWN THE LONG AVENUE AND THE WOOD OPENED AGAIN TO LET THEM PASS. OUTSIDE THEY MET THE PRINCE'S FOLLOWERS WHO WERE OVERJOYED TO SEE THEIR MASTER. HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD
