ALL THAT NIGHT THE PRETTY SILLY FLOWERS BEWAILED THEIR SLAVISH CONDITION AND LONGED FOR RELEASE AND FREEDOM AND AT LAST THEY BEGAN TO BE AFRAID THAT THE WIND HAD ONLY BEEN JESTING WITH THEM AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER COME TO HELP THEM AS HE HAD PROMISED. HOWEVER THEY WERE MISTAKEN FOR AT THE EDGE OF THE DAWN THERE BEGAN TO BE A SIGHING AND A MOANING IN THE DISTANT WOODS AND BY THE TIME THE SUN WAS UP THE CLOUDS WERE DRIVING FAST ALONG THE SKY AND THE TREES WERE BENDING ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR THE WIND HAD RETURNED ONLY NOW HE HAD COME IN HIS ROUGHEST AND WILDEST MOOD KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING BEFORE HIM. ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH. HE MANAGED THE AFFAIR VERY CLEVERLY IT MUST BE CONFESSED. MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOLVULUS POLE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELLED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND. IN SHORT IN ONE HALF HOUR HE DESOLATED THE PRETTY GARDEN AND WHEN HIS WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED HE FLEW OFF. MEANWHILE HOW FARED IT WITH THE FLOWERS. THE WIND WAS SCARCELY GONE BEFORE A SUDDEN AND HEAVY RAIN FOLLOWED SO THAT ALL WAS CONFUSION FOR SOME TIME. BUT TOWARDS THE EVENING THE WEATHER CLEARED UP AND OUR FRIENDS BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND THEM. THE WHITE LILY STILL STOOD SOMEWHAT UPRIGHT THOUGH NO FRIENDLY POLE SUPPORTED HER JUICY STEM BUT ALAS. IT WAS ONLY BY A PAINFUL EFFORT SHE COULD HOLD HERSELF IN THAT POSITION. THE CONVOLVULUS FARED STILL WORSE. THE GARDEN BEDS SLOPED TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND WHEN OUR FRIEND WAS LAID ON THE EARTH HER POLE HAVING FALLEN HER LOVELY FLOWERS WERE CHOKED UP BY THE WET SOIL WHICH DRAINED TOWARDS HER. SHE FELT THE MUDDY WEIGHT AS IT SOAKED INTO HER BEAUTIFUL VELVET BELLS AND COULD HAVE CRIED FOR GRIEF SHE COULD NEVER FREE HERSELF FROM THIS NUISANCE. OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FIR POLE. THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATION WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELLED HER TO THE DIRT. BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES. HE EXPECTED TO SEE A FEW DROOPING FLOWERS AND TO FIND THAT ONE OR TWO FASTENINGS HAD GIVEN WAY. BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL. THEN AT LAST HE BROKE OUT INTO WORDS OF ABSOLUTE SORROW AND TO THINK OF MY MISTRESS AND THE YOUNG LADY COMING HOME SO SOON AND THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE TO THESE POOR THINGS FOR A FORTNIGHT BECAUSE OF THE CORN HARVEST. IT'S ALL OVER WITH THEM I FEAR AND THE GARDENER WENT HIS WAY ALAS. WHAT HE SAID WAS TRUE AND BEFORE MANY DAYS HAD PASSED THE SHATTERED CARNATIONS WERE ROTTED WITH LYING IN THE WET AND DIRT ON THE GROUND. WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION REIGNED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN. AT LENGTH ONE DAY BEFORE THE FORTNIGHT WAS OVER THE HOUSE DOG WAS HEARD TO BARK HIS NOISY WELCOME AND SERVANTS BUSTLED TO AND FRO. THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVOURITE GARDEN
