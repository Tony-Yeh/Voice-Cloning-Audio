THEN THE WIND ASSURED THE ROSE HE NEVER MEANT TO DISPUTE THE ADVANTAGE OF HER LIVING IN A RICH SOILED GARDEN ONLY THERE WAS A NATURAL WAY OF GROWING EVEN IN A GARDEN AND HE THOUGHT IT A GREAT SHAME FOR THE GARDENERS TO FORCE THE ROSE TREE INTO AN UN NATURAL WAY CURTAILING ALL THE ENERGIES OF HER NATURE. WHAT COULD BE MORE OUTRAGEOUS FOR EXAMPLE THAN TO SEE ONE ROSE GROWING IN THE SHAPE OF A BUSH ON THE TOP OF THE STEM OF ANOTHER. THINK OF ALL THE PRUNING NECESSARY CRIED HE TO KEEP THE POOR THING IN THE ROUND SHAPE SO MUCH ADMIRED. AND WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THE BEAUTIFUL STRAGGLING BRANCHES THAT THEY ARE TO BE CUT OFF AS FAST AS THEY APPEAR. WHY NOT ALLOW THE HEALTHY ROSE TREE ITS FREE AND GLORIOUS GROWTH. CAN IT BE TOO LARGE OR TOO LUXURIANT. CAN ITS FLOWERS BE TOO NUMEROUS. AND SO SHE DID AND A NEW LIGHT SEEMED TO DAWN UPON HER AS SHE RECOLLECTED THE SPRING AND AUTUMNAL PRUNINGS SHE REGULARLY UNDERWENT AND THE QUANTITIES OF LITTLE BRANCHES THAT WERE YEARLY CUT FROM HER SIDES AND CARRIED AWAY IN A WHEEL BARROW. THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY INTO WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK. HE REALLY GRIEVED TO SEE IT. DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE. ALWAYS THIS TYING UP AND RESTRAINT. PURSUED THE WIND WITH AN ANGRY PUFF. PERHAPS I AM PREJUDICED BUT AS TO BE DEPRIVED OF FREEDOM WOULD BE TO ME ABSOLUTE DEATH SO MY SOUL REVOLTS FROM EVERY SHAPE AND PHASE OF SLAVERY. NOT MORE THAN MINE DOES. CRIED THE PROUD WHITE LILY LEANING AS HEAVILY AS SHE COULD AGAINST THE STRIP OF MATTING THAT TIED HER TO HER STICK. BUT IT WAS OF NO USE SHE COULD NOT GET FREE AND THE WIND ONLY SHOOK HIS SIDES AND LAUGHED SPITEFULLY AS HE LEFT HER AND THEN RAMBLED AWAY TO TALK THE SAME SHALLOW PHILOSOPHY TO THE HONEYSUCKLE THAT WAS TRAINED UP AGAINST A WALL. INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS. HE MURMURED AMONG THEM ALL LAUGHED THE TRIM CUT BOX EDGES TO SCORN MALICIOUSLY HOPED THE SWEET PEAS ENJOYED GROWING IN A CIRCLE AND RUNNING UP A QUANTITY OF CROOKED STICKS AND TOLD THE FLOWERS GENERALLY THAT HE SHOULD REPORT THEIR UNHEARD OF SUBMISSION AND MEEK OBEDIENCE WHEREVER HE WENT. THEN THE WHITE LILY CALLED OUT TO HIM IN GREAT WRATH AND TOLD HIM HE MISTOOK THEIR CHARACTERS ALTOGETHER. THEY ONLY SUBMITTED TO THESE DEGRADING RESTRAINTS BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT HELP THEMSELVES BUT IF HE WOULD LEND THEM HIS POWERFUL AID THEY MIGHT FREE THEMSELVES FROM AT LEAST A PART OF THE UNNATURAL BONDS WHICH ENTHRALLED THEM. TO WHICH THE WICKED WIND SEEING THAT HIS TEMPTATIONS HAD SUCCEEDED REPLIED IN GREAT GLEE THAT HE WOULD DO HIS BEST AND SO HE WENT AWAY CHUCKLING AT THE DISCONTENT HE HAD CAUSED
