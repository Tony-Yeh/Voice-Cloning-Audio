WHAT A FUSS IS MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS. MURMURED THE WIND ONE DAY TO THE FLOWERS IN A PRETTY VILLA GARDEN. I AM REALLY QUITE SURPRISED AT YOUR SUBMITTING SO PATIENTLY AND MEEKLY TO ALL THE TROUBLESOME THINGS THAT ARE DONE TO YOU. I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOUR FRIEND THE GARDENER FOR SOME TIME TO DAY AND NOW THAT HE IS GONE AT LAST I AM QUITE CURIOUS TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK AND FEEL ABOUT YOUR UNNATURAL BRINGING UP. IS IT UNNATURAL. INQUIRED A BEAUTIFUL CONVOLVULUS MAJOR FROM THE TOP OF A TAPERING FIR POLE UP WHICH SHE HAD CREPT AND FROM WHICH HER VELVET FLOWERS HUNG SUSPENDED LIKE PURPLE GEMS. I SMILE AT YOUR QUESTION WAS THE ANSWER OF THE WIND. YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BARE STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW. OH DEAR NO. YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CONVOLVULUS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU. SHE RUNS ALONG AND CLIMBS ABOUT JUST AS THE WHIM TAKES HER. SOMETIMES SHE TAKES A TURN UPON THE GROUND SOMETIMES SHE ENTERS A HEDGE AND PLAYS AT BO PEEP WITH THE BIRDS IN THE THORN AND NUT TREES TWISTING HERE CURLING THERE AND AT LAST PERHAPS COMING OUT AT THE TOP AND OVERHANGING THE EDGE WITH A CANOPY OF GREEN LEAVES AND PRETTY WHITE FLOWERS. I QUITE FEEL FOR YOU. STILL I MUST SAY YOU MAKE ME SMILE FOR YOU LOOK SO PROUD AND SELF CONSCIOUS OF BEAUTY ALL THE TIME THAT ONE WOULD THINK YOU DID NOT KNOW IN WHAT A RIDICULOUS AND DEPENDENT POSITION YOU ARE PLACED. NOW THE CONVOLVULUS WAS QUITE ABASHED BY THE WORDS OF THE WIND FOR SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF FEELING VERY CONCEITED THAT MORNING IN CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING HEARD THE GARDENER SAY SOMETHING VERY FLATTERING ABOUT HER BEAUTY SO SHE HUNG DOWN HER RICH BELL FLOWERS RATHER LOWER THAN USUAL AND MADE NO REPLY. I AM NOT AWARE THAT I HAVE ANY POOR RELATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY AND I MYSELF CERTAINLY REQUIRE ALL THE CARE THAT IS BESTOWED UPON ME. THIS CLIMATE IS BOTH TOO COLD AND TOO DAMP FOR ME. MY YOUNG PLANTS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE POTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROY OUR ROOTS. WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXURIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER. WHY MUST EVERY SINGLE FLOWER BETIED UP BY ITS DELICATE NECK TO A STICK THE MOMENT IT BEGINS TO OPEN. REALLY WITH YOUR NATURAL GRACE AND BEAUTY I THINK YOU MIGHT BE TRUSTED TO YOURSELF A LITTLE MORE. AND THE CARNATION BEGAN TO THINK SO TOO AND HER COLOUR TURNED DEEPER AS A FEELING OF INDIGNATION AROSE WITHIN HER AT THE CHILDISH TREATMENT TO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED. WITH MY NATURAL GRACE AND BEAUTY REPEATED SHE TO HERSELF THEY MIGHT CERTAINLY TRUST ME TO MYSELF A LITTLE MORE. STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS
