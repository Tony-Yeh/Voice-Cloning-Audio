SHE CAME BOUNDING TOWARDS THE WELL KNOWN SPOT WITH A SONG OF JOYOUS DELIGHT BUT ON REACHING IT SUDDENLY STOPPED SHORT AND IN A MINUTE AFTER BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS. PRESENTLY WITH SORROWING STEPS SHE BENT HER WAY ROUND THE FLOWER BEDS WEEPING AFRESH AT EVERY ONE SHE LOOKED AT AND THEN SHE SAT DOWN UPON THE LAWN AND HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS. IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER. THIS IS A SAD SIGHT INDEED MY DARLING SAID HER MOTHER'S VOICE. I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH. I AM THINKING THAT NOW AT LAST I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF TRAINING AND RESTRAINT AND CULTURE FOR US AS WELL AS FOR FLOWERS. THE WIND HAS TORN AWAY THESE POOR THINGS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS AND THEY ARE GROWING WILD WHICHEVER WAY THEY PLEASE AND I MIGHT PERHAPS ONCE HAVE ARGUED THAT IF IT WERE THEIR NATURAL WAY OF GROWING IT MUST THEREFORE BE THE BEST. BUT I CANNOT SAY SO NOW I SEE THE RESULT
