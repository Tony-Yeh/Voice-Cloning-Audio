BUT DEUCALION AND PYRRHA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND. AT LAST THEY STARTED TO WALK DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE TOWARDS THE PLAIN WONDERING WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THEM NOW ALL ALONE AS THEY WERE IN THE WIDE WORLD. WHILE THEY WERE TALKING AND TRYING TO THINK WHAT THEY SHOULD DO THEY HEARD A VOICE BEHIND THEM. HE WAS VERY TALL WITH BLUE EYES AND YELLOW HAIR. THERE WERE WINGS ON HIS SHOES AND ON HIS CAP AND IN HIS HANDS HE BORE A STAFF WITH GOLDEN SERPENTS TWINED AROUND IT. THEY KNEW AT ONCE THAT HE WAS MERCURY THE SWIFT MESSENGER OF THE MIGHTY ONES AND THEY WAITED TO HEAR WHAT HE WOULD SAY. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED. TELL ME AND YOU SHALL HAVE WHATEVER YOU DESIRE. WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DEUCALION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED. GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE. WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PYRRHA. SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DEUCALION. BUT LET US THINK A MOMENT. AND SO THEY WALKED ON DOWN THE STEEP SLOPE OF MOUNT PARNASSUS AND AS THEY WALKED THEY PICKED UP THE LOOSE STONES IN THEIR WAY AND CAST THEM OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AND STRANGE TO SAY THE STONES WHICH DEUCALION THREW SPRANG UP AS FULL GROWN MEN STRONG AND HANDSOME AND BRAVE AND THE STONES WHICH PYRRHA THREW SPRANG UP AS FULL GROWN WOMEN LOVELY AND FAIR. WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM. SO DEUCALION BECAME THEIR KING AND HE SET THEM IN HOMES AND TAUGHT THEM HOW TO TILL THE GROUND AND HOW TO DO MANY USEFUL THINGS AND THE LAND WAS FILLED WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE HAPPIER AND FAR BETTER THAN THOSE WHO HAD DWELT THERE BEFORE THE FLOOD. AND THEY NAMED THE COUNTRY HELLAS AFTER HELLEN THE SON OF DEUCALION AND PYRRHA AND THE PEOPLE ARE TO THIS DAY CALLED HELLENES
