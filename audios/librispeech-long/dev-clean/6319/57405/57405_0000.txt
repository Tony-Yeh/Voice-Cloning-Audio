IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DEUCALION AND HE WAS THE SON OF PROMETHEUS. HE WAS ONLY A COMMON MAN AND NOT A TITAN LIKE HIS GREAT FATHER AND YET HE WAS KNOWN FAR AND WIDE FOR HIS GOOD DEEDS AND THE UPRIGHTNESS OF HIS LIFE. HIS WIFE'S NAME WAS PYRRHA AND SHE WAS ONE OF THE FAIREST OF THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN. AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED. THEY NO LONGER BUILT HOUSES AND TENDED THEIR FLOCKS AND LIVED TOGETHER IN PEACE BUT EVERY MAN WAS AT WAR WITH HIS NEIGHBOR AND THERE WAS NO LAW NOR SAFETY IN ALL THE LAND. THINGS WERE IN MUCH WORSE CASE NOW THAN THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE PROMETHEUS HAD COME AMONG MEN AND THAT WAS JUST WHAT JUPITER WANTED. BUT AS THE WORLD BECAME WICKEDER AND WICKEDER EVERY DAY HE BEGAN TO GROW WEARY OF SEEING SO MUCH BLOODSHED AND OF HEARING THE CRIES OF THE OPPRESSED AND THE POOR. THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE. WHEN THEY WERE GOOD AND HAPPY WE FELT AFRAID LEST THEY SHOULD BECOME GREATER THAN OURSELVES AND NOW THEY ARE SO TERRIBLY WICKED THAT WE ARE IN WORSE DANGER THAN BEFORE. THERE IS ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE WITH THEM AND THAT IS TO DESTROY THEM EVERY ONE. SO HE SENT A GREAT RAIN STORM UPON THE EARTH AND IT RAINED DAY AND NIGHT FOR A LONG TIME AND THE SEA WAS FILLED TO THE BRIM AND THE WATER RAN OVER THE LAND AND COVERED FIRST THE PLAINS AND THEN THE FORESTS AND THEN THE HILLS. BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND. NO ONE BUT DEUCALION THE SON OF PROMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM. HE HAD NEVER JOINED IN ANY OF THE WRONG DOINGS OF THOSE AROUND HIM AND HAD OFTEN TOLD THEM THAT UNLESS THEY LEFT OFF THEIR EVIL WAYS THERE WOULD BE A DAY OF RECKONING IN THE END. ONCE EVERY YEAR HE HAD GONE TO THE LAND OF THE CAUCASUS TO TALK WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS HANGING CHAINED TO THE MOUNTAIN PEAK. THE DAY IS COMING SAID PROMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH. BE SURE THAT YOU ARE READY FOR IT MY SON. AND SO WHEN THE RAIN BEGAN TO FALL DEUCALION DREW FROM ITS SHELTER A BOAT WHICH HE HAD BUILT FOR JUST SUCH A TIME. HE CALLED FAIR PYRRHA HIS WIFE AND THE TWO SAT IN THE BOAT AND WERE FLOATED SAFELY ON THE RISING WATERS. DAY AND NIGHT DAY AND NIGHT I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG THE BOAT DRIFTED HITHER AND THITHER. THE TOPS OF THE TREES WERE HIDDEN BY THE FLOOD AND THEN THE HILLS AND THEN THE MOUNTAINS AND DEUCALION AND PYRRHA COULD SEE NOTHING ANYWHERE BUT WATER WATER WATER AND THEY KNEW THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE LAND HAD BEEN DROWNED. AFTER A WHILE THE RAIN STOPPED FALLING AND THE CLOUDS CLEARED AWAY AND THE BLUE SKY AND THE GOLDEN SUN CAME OUT OVERHEAD. THEN THE WATER BEGAN TO SINK VERY FAST AND TO RUN OFF THE LAND TOWARDS THE SEA AND EARLY THE VERY NEXT DAY THE BOAT WAS DRIFTED HIGH UPON A MOUNTAIN CALLED PARNASSUS AND DEUCALION AND PYRRHA STEPPED OUT UPON THE DRY LAND. AFTER THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHORT TIME UNTIL THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS LAID BARE AND THE TREES SHOOK THEIR LEAFY BRANCHES IN THE WIND AND THE FIELDS WERE CARPETED WITH GRASS AND FLOWERS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE FLOOD
