ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOLIN SET OUT FOR TESTBRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA. IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY. WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOTPATH. HIS BEING WAS LIKE AN ALL SIDED LENS CONCENTRATING ALL JOYS IN THE ONE HEART OF HIS CONSCIOUSNESS. GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW BLESSED HE COULD MAKE US IF WE WOULD BUT LET HIM. HE PRESSED HIS VIOLIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT. EARTH WAS GONE AND HEAVEN WAS ALL. BLESSED AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESSED SHALL I BE THERE THEN. WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLORS. EVERY NEST HAS ITS OWN BIRDS SAID JOSEPH EVERY HEART ITS OWN JOYS. JUST THEN HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS. THE NETTLE AND THE DOCK SAID JOSEPH. WHEN HE REACHED MARY'S SHOP HE TURNED INTO THE COURT TO THE KITCHEN DOOR. THROUGH THE KITCHEN TO THE PARLOR HE SAID. THROUGH THE SMITHY TO THE PRESENCE CHAMBER O MY GOD THROUGH THE MUD OF ME UP TO THY RIGHTEOUSNESS. HE WAS IN A MOOD FOR MUSIC WAS HE NOT. MARY CAME HALF WAY TO MEET HIM. THE PRESSURE AS OF HEAVEN'S ATMOSPHERE FELL AROUND HIM CALMING AND ELEVATING. HE STEPPED ACROSS THE FLOOR STILL STATELY AND FREE. HE LAID DOWN HIS VIOLIN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE. THEY HAD NOT GONE FAR ON THE WAY TO FAIRYLAND HOWEVER WHEN BEENIE CALLED LETTY FROM THE ROOM TO SPEAK TO A FRIEND AND CUSTOMER WHO HAD COME FROM THE COUNTRY ON A SUDDEN NECESSITY FOR SOMETHING FROM THE SHOP. LETTY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITOR. THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRUMENTS. BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VIOLIN WERE SURE TO MARRY IN MUSIC. THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE. MARY HAD NOT LISTENED LONG BEFORE SHE FOUND HERSELF STRANGELY MOVED. HER HEART SEEMED TO SWELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPING. A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY. LETTY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC. SHE WAS NOT SO OPEN TO ITS INFLUENCES AS MARY BUT HER EYES WERE FULL AND SHE SAT THINKING OF HER TOM FAR IN THE REGIONS THAT ARE NONE THE LESS TRUE THAT WE CAN NOT SEE THEM. A MOOD HAD TAKEN SHAPE IN THE MIND OF THE BLACKSMITH AND WANDERED FROM ITS HOME SEEKING ANOTHER COUNTRY. IT IS NOT THE GHOSTS OF EVIL DEEDS THAT ALONE TAKE SHAPE AND GO FORTH TO WANDER THE EARTH. LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD AS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HAUNT THE WORLD. THUS IN A GARMENT OF MOOD WHOSE COLOR AND TEXTURE WAS MUSIC DID THE SOUL OF JOSEPH JASPER THAT EVENING LIKE A HOMELESS GHOST COME KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF MARY MARSTON
