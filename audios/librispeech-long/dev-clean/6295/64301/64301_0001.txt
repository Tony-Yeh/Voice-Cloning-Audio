AND THERE MARY SAW JOSEPH STAND THINKING HIMSELF ALONE WITH HIS VIOLIN AND THE VIOLIN WAS HIS MEDIATOR WITH HER AND WAS PLEADING AND PLEADING FOR THE ADMITTANCE OF ITS MASTER. IT PRAYED IT WEPT IT IMPLORED. IT CRIED ALOUD THAT ETERNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM. GORGEOUS IS THE GLORY IT SANG WHITE ARE THE GARMENTS AND LOVELY ARE THE FACES OF THE HOLY THEY LOOK UPON ME GENTLY AND SWEETLY BUT PITIFULLY FOR THEY KNOW THAT I AM ALONE YET NOT ALONE FOR I LOVE. ALL THE TIME JOSEPH KNEW NOTHING OF WHERE HIS SOUL WAS FOR HE THOUGHT MARY WAS IN THE SHOP AND BEYOND THE HEARING OF HIS PLEADER. NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICIAN. ON THE BOUGH OF AN APPLE TREE IN THE FAIR MOONLIGHT SAT A NIGHTINGALE SWAYING TO AND FRO LIKE ONE MAD WITH THE WINE OF HIS OWN MUSIC SINGING AS IF HE WANTED TO BREAK HIS HEART AND HAVE DONE FOR THE DELIGHT WAS TOO MUCH FOR MORTAL CREATURE TO ENDURE. AND THE SONG OF THE BIRD GREW THE PRAYER OF A MAN IN THE BRAIN AND HEART OF THE MUSICIAN AND THENCE BURST THROUGH THE OPEN FOUNTAIN OF THE VIOLIN AND WORKED WHAT IT COULD WORK IN THE WORLD OF FORCES I LOVE THEE. I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTREATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF. AH DO NOT BLAME THOU WHO LOVEST GOD AND FEAREST THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN. HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF A PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD. WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLORIES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE. FOR THAT MORE LOVE TOGETHER THEY SUFFERED AND PATIENTLY WAITED. HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL HE LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NOT SEEN. A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM MARY'S BOSOM. IT BROKE THE ENCHANTMENT IN WHICH JOSEPH WAS BOUND. THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM USURPING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER. HE STARTED TO CONSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID. HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLIN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO THEN SOMEHOW STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL. IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT PART FROM THE BODY WITH A TEARING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD. HE STOOD UP UNDERSTANDING NOW HOLDING IN HIS HAND HIS DEAD MUSIC AND REGARDING IT WITH A SMILE SAD AS A WINTER SUNSET GLEAMING OVER A GRAVE. BUT MARY DARTED TO HIM THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIM LAID HER HEAD ON HIS BOSOM AND BURST INTO TEARS. HIS VIOLIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE
