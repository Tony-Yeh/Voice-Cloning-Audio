HE GAZED UPON A WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS. BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THE VOLATILE AND THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION. IT WAS ALMOST BURIED NOW IN FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE. THE VERY TRIUMPH AND JOY OF LIVING PENETRATED HIS SOUL. YOUTH SWEPT ASIDE THE TERRORS OF WAR. HE WAS GOING HOME AFTER VICTORY. HE SOON LEFT CHARLESTON OUT OF SIGHT. A LAST ROOF OR STEEPLE GLITTERED FOR A MOMENT IN THE SUN AND THEN WAS GONE. BEFORE HIM LAY THE UPLANDS AND THE RIDGES AND IN ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD BE IN ANOTHER LAND. HE LEARNED FROM CASUAL TALK ON THE TRAINS THAT AFFAIRS IN KENTUCKY WERE VERY HOT. THE WOMEN OF THE STATE HAD ALREADY PREPARED AN APPEAL TO THE LEGISLATURE TO SAVE THEM FROM THE HORRORS OF CIVIL WAR HARRY SAW THAT HE HAD NOT LEFT ACTIVE LIFE BEHIND HIM WHEN HE CAME AWAY FROM CHARLESTON THE FEELING OF STRIFE HAD SPREAD OVER A VAST AREA. ALL THE WINDS BLEW IN THE SAME DIRECTION IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND THEY SANG ONE SONG OF TRIUMPH BUT IN KENTUCKY THEY WERE VARIABLE AND CONFLICTING AND THEIR VOICES WERE MANY. HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATE. PEOPLE WERE COOLER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION. THE AIR TOO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SOUTH CAROLINA THERE WAS A SHARPER TANG TO IT. IT WHIPPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW DOWN FROM THE SLOPES AND CRESTS. IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WINTON AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIZE STRENGTH AND AGILITY. HARRY YOU'VE CHANGED A LOT IN SO SHORT A TIME YOU WERE AT THE BOMBARDMENT OF FORT SUMTER THEY TELL ME IT'S MADE A MIGHTY STIR IN THESE PARTS. THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES IN OLD KENTUCKY. BILL SKELLY AN HIS GANG THEM MOUNTAINEERS ARE UP. THEY SAY THEY'RE GOIN TO BEAT THE RICH MEN OF THE LOWLANDS AN KEEP KENTUCKY IN THE UNION BUT BETWEEN YOU AN ME HARRY IT'S THE HATE THEY FEEL FOR THEM THAT THINK HARDER AN WORK HARDER AN MAKE MORE THAN THEMSELVES. BILL SKELLY IS THE WORST MAN IN THE MOUNTAINS AN HE HAS GATHERED ABOUT HIM A BIG GANG OF TOUGHS. I WILL REPLIED HARRY WITH VIVID RECOLLECTION OF HIS RIDE FROM PENDLETON TO WINTON. I SERVED IN ONE OF THE BATTERIES THAT REDUCED FORT SUMTER. HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERYMAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT. IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID COLLINS. THINGS ARE SHORELY MIGHTY TROUBLED IN THESE PARTS AN THEY'RE GOIN TO BE WORSE. HARRY THANKED HIM THREW HIS SADDLE BAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIVERYMAN RODE AWAY. THE HORSE AS HE SOON SAW WAS OF UNCOMMON POWER AND SPIRIT AND HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERS AT SKELLY AND HIS GANG. IN THE TWO HOURS BEFORE SUNDOWN HE MET LESS THAN HALF A DOZEN PERSONS. ALL WERE MEN AND WITH A MERE NOD THEY WENT ON QUICKLY REGARDING HIM WITH SUSPICION. THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE. BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED. THE INTERVENING SPACE WAS A MASS OF HEAVY GREEN FOLIAGE WHICH THE EYE NOW THAT THE TWILIGHT WAS AT HAND COULD PENETRATE ONLY A FEW SCORE YARDS
