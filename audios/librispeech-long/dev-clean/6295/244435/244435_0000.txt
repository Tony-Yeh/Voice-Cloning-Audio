CHAPTER SEVEN THE HOMECOMING. A GREAT AND EXULTANT CHEER WENT UP FROM THE MASSED THOUSANDS IN CHARLESTON. COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT REGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY. BUT THE EMOTIONS OF HARRY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF VICTORY ONLY. BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FORT AND THE SHORE. A LIGHT BREEZE HAD SPRUNG UP AND IT WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO HARRY WHO FOR HOURS HAD BREATHED THE HEAVY ODORS OF SMOKE AND BURNED GUNPOWDER. THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER HARBOR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS ETCHED SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY. THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SUMTER IS OURS. EVERYTHING IS FOR THE BEST AND WE WIN EVERYWHERE AND ALL THE TIME. HARRY WAS SILENT HE WAS WATCHING THE BOATS. BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED. ALL THE AMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS. THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSEE AND ARKANSAS FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE. LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION BUT HARRY HEARD EVERYWHERE IN CHARLESTON THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS NOW SECURE. THE SOUTHERNERS WERE RISING BY THE THOUSANDS TO DEFEND IT. THE WOMEN TOO WERE FULL OF ZEAL AND ENTHUSIASM AND THEY URGED THE MEN TO GO TO THE FRONT. THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT DAVIS TO THE NEW CAPITAL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOYALTY. HARRY HEARD NOTHING IN CHARLESTON BUT JOYFUL NEWS. THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF GLOOM. EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FAVOR THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH. MEN GAVE FREELY AND WITHOUT ASKING TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT. AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYBODY WITH IT. CHARLESTON SHOUTED ANEW AS THE NEWSPAPERS ANNOUNCED THE NEWS OF DISTINGUISHED OFFICERS WHO HAD GONE OUT WITH THE SOUTHERN STATES. THERE WERE THE TWO JOHNSTONS THE ONE OF VIRGINIA AND THE OTHER OF KENTUCKY LEE BRAGG OF BUENA VISTA FAME LONGSTREET AND MANY OTHERS SOME ALREADY CELEBRATED IN THE MEXICAN WAR AND OTHERS WITH A GREATER FAME YET TO MAKE. HARRY HEARD IT ALL AND IT WAS TRANSFUSED INTO HIS OWN BLOOD. NOW A LETTER CAME FROM HIS FATHER THAT OBSTINATE FACTION IN KENTUCKY STILL HELD THE STATE TO THE UNION. HIS PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF THE GLOWING DEED THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN CHARLESTON HARBOR WOULD HELP. HARRY'S HEART AND JUDGMENT ALIKE RESPONDED TO THE CALL HE TOOK THE LETTER TO GENERAL BEAUREGARD FINDING HIM AT THE CHARLESTON HOTEL WITH GOVERNOR PICKENS AND OFFICERS OF HIS STAFF AND STOOD ASIDE WHILE THE GENERAL READ IT. BEAUREGARD AT ONCE WROTE AN ORDER. THIS IS YOUR DISCHARGE FROM THE PALMETTO GUARDS HE SAID. COLONEL KENTON WRITES WISELY. WE NEED KENTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE. HARRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DELAUNAY'S WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE. HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SOUGHT HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOOD BYE. HARRY GAVE HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET. WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS GRAVE OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN. IT WAS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARTED HOME LATE IN APRIL. FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED AND GRAVE. HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF THEM
