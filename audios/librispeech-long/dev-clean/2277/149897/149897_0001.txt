THE THOUGHT THAT THIS LETTER WOULD PROBABLY NOT REACH HER UNTIL MONDAY CHAFED HIM EXCEEDINGLY. HE MUST GET SOME SPEEDIER METHOD BUT HOW. HE THOUGHT UPON IT FOR A HALF HOUR NOT CONTEMPLATING A MESSENGER OR A CAB DIRECT TO THE HOUSE OWING TO THE EXPOSURE OF IT BUT FINDING THAT TIME WAS SLIPPING AWAY TO NO PURPOSE HE WROTE THE LETTER AND THEN BEGAN TO THINK AGAIN. THE HOURS SLIPPED BY AND WITH THEM THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UNION HE HAD CONTEMPLATED. HE HAD THOUGHT TO BE JOYOUSLY AIDING CARRIE BY NOW IN THE TASK OF JOINING HER INTERESTS TO HIS AND HERE IT WAS AFTERNOON AND NOTHING DONE. THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER. THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GLOOM OF DEFEAT. HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE. ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROODED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM CARRIE AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IOTA. IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE. IN MONDAY'S SECOND MAIL HE ENCOUNTERED A VERY LEGAL LOOKING LETTER WHICH HELD HIS INTEREST FOR SOME TIME. HE READ IT THROUGH CAREFULLY SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN MERELY SHOOK HIS HEAD. IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING. WELL HE SAID AFTER A TIME QUITE AUDIBLY I DON'T KNOW. THEN HE FOLDED IT UP AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET. TO ADD TO HIS MISERY THERE WAS NO WORD FROM CARRIE. HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED AT HIS PERFIDY. HIS LOSS SEEMED ALL THE MORE BITTER NOW THAT HE NEEDED HER MOST. HE THOUGHT HE WOULD GO OUT AND INSIST ON SEEING HER IF SHE DID NOT SEND HIM WORD OF SOME SORT SOON. HE WAS REALLY AFFECTED MOST MISERABLY OF ALL BY THIS DESERTION. HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE. HE REALLY PINED FOR A WORD AND LOOKED OUT UPON HER WITH HIS MIND'S EYE IN THE MOST WISTFUL MANNER. HE DID NOT PROPOSE TO LOSE HER WHATEVER SHE MIGHT THINK. COME WHAT MIGHT HE WOULD ADJUST THIS MATTER AND SOON. HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLICATIONS. HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER. SURELY SHE COULDN'T GO BACK ON HIM NOW IT WASN'T POSSIBLE. HE WOULD PLEAD UNTIL HER ANGER WOULD MELT UNTIL SHE WOULD FORGIVE HIM. SUDDENLY HE THOUGHT SUPPOSING SHE ISN'T OUT THERE SUPPOSE SHE HAS GONE HE WAS FORCED TO TAKE HIS FEET. IT WAS TOO MUCH TO THINK OF AND SIT STILL. NEVERTHELESS HIS ROUSING AVAILED HIM NOTHING. ON TUESDAY IT WAS THE SAME WAY. HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRIE BUT WHEN HE GOT IN OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY. HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE. ONE OF THE GALLING INCIDENTS OF THIS VISIT WAS THAT HE CAME BACK ON A RANDOLPH STREET CAR AND WITHOUT NOTICING ARRIVED ALMOST OPPOSITE THE BUILDING OF THE CONCERN WITH WHICH HIS SON WAS CONNECTED THIS SENT A PANG THROUGH HIS HEART. HE HAD CALLED ON HIS BOY THERE SEVERAL TIMES. NOW THE LAD HAD NOT SENT HIM A WORD. HIS ABSENCE DID NOT SEEM TO BE NOTICED BY EITHER OF HIS CHILDREN. WELL WELL FORTUNE PLAYS A MAN QUEER TRICKS. HE GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AND JOINED IN A CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDS. IT WAS AS IF IDLE CHATTER DEADENED THE SENSE OF MISERY. THAT NIGHT HE DINED AT RECTOR'S AND RETURNED AT ONCE TO HIS OFFICE. IN THE BUSTLE AND SHOW OF THE LATTER WAS HIS ONLY RELIEF. HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO EVERYBODY. HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED. ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND HAY IT READ. DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AND ALIMONY.

EXCLAIMED HURSTWOOD BITTERLY COMPROMISE AGAIN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
