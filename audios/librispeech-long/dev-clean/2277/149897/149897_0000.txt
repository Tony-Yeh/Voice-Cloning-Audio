ASHES OF TINDER THE LOOSING OF STAYS. WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER. LORD LORD HE THOUGHT WHAT HAD HE GOT INTO. HOW COULD THINGS HAVE TAKEN SUCH A VIOLENT TURN AND SO QUICKLY. HE COULD HARDLY REALISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT. IT SEEMED A MONSTROUS UNNATURAL UNWARRANTED CONDITION WHICH HAD SUDDENLY DESCENDED UPON HIM WITHOUT HIS LET OR HINDRANCE. MEANWHILE HE GAVE A THOUGHT NOW AND THEN TO CARRIE. WHAT COULD BE THE TROUBLE IN THAT QUARTER. NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING. TO MORROW THEY WERE TO HAVE MET AND GONE OFF WHERE. HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE. HE WAS DESPERATELY IN LOVE AND WOULD HAVE TAKEN GREAT CHANCES TO WIN HER UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT NOW NOW WHAT. SUPPOSING SHE HAD FOUND OUT SOMETHING. IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN AS THINGS WERE GOING NOW. MEANWHILE HE HAD NOT SENT THE MONEY. HE STROLLED UP AND DOWN THE POLISHED FLOOR OF THE RESORT HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS HIS BROW WRINKLED HIS MOUTH SET. HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM. HIS WHOLE NATURE WAS VIGOROUSLY AND POWERFULLY SHAKEN UP AND HE WAS FINDING WHAT LIMITS THE MIND HAS TO ENDURANCE. HE DRANK MORE BRANDY AND SODA THAN HE HAD ANY EVENING IN MONTHS. HE WAS ALTOGETHER A FINE EXAMPLE OF GREAT MENTAL PERTURBATION. FOR ALL HIS STUDY NOTHING CAME OF THE EVENING EXCEPT THIS HE SENT THE MONEY. IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED IT UP. THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE. YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY. IF SHE ISN'T THERE BRING IT BACK YES SIR. YOU'VE SEEN MY WIFE. HE ASKED AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AS THE BOY TURNED TO GO. OH YES SIR I KNOW HER. ALL RIGHT NOW HURRY RIGHT BACK. ANY ANSWER I GUESS NOT. THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSINGS. NOW HE HAD DONE IT THERE WAS NO USE SPECULATING OVER THAT. HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT. BUT OH THE WRETCHEDNESS OF BEING FORCED THIS WAY. HE COULD SEE HER MEETING THE BOY AT THE DOOR AND SMILING SARDONICALLY. SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOPE AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED. IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T SEND IT. HE BREATHED HEAVILY AND WIPED THE MOISTURE FROM HIS FACE. FOR RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING. HE TRIED TO GET THE INTEREST OF THINGS ABOUT HIM BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE. ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED. ALL THE TIME HE WAS WONDERING WHAT SHE WOULD SAY WHEN THE BOY HANDED HER THE ENVELOPE. IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED. WELL SAID HURSTWOOD. I GAVE IT TO HER MY WIFE. YES SIR ANY ANSWER. SHE SAID IT WAS HIGH TIME. HURSTWOOD SCOWLED FIERCELY. THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE DONE UPON THAT SCORE THAT NIGHT. HE WENT ON BROODING OVER HIS SITUATION UNTIL MIDNIGHT WHEN HE REPAIRED AGAIN TO THE PALMER HOUSE. HE WONDERED WHAT THE MORNING WOULD BRING FORTH AND SLEPT ANYTHING BUT SOUNDLY UPON IT. NEXT DAY HE WENT AGAIN TO THE OFFICE AND OPENED HIS MAIL SUSPICIOUS AND HOPEFUL OF ITS CONTENTS NO WORD FROM CARRIE. NOTHING FROM HIS WIFE WHICH WAS PLEASANT THE FACT THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY AND THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED IT WORKED TO THE EASE OF HIS MIND FOR AS THE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD DONE IT RECEDED HIS CHAGRIN AT IT GREW LESS AND HIS HOPE OF PEACE MORE. HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK. HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR WRITE HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THIS SUBJECT. HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
