THAT NIGHT HURSTWOOD REMAINED DOWN TOWN ENTIRELY GOING TO THE PALMER HOUSE FOR A BED AFTER HIS WORK WAS THROUGH. HE WAS IN A FEVERED STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE. WHILE HE WAS NOT SURE HOW MUCH SIGNIFICANCE MIGHT BE ATTACHED TO THE THREAT SHE HAD MADE HE WAS SURE THAT HER ATTITUDE IF LONG CONTINUED WOULD CAUSE HIM NO END OF TROUBLE. SHE WAS DETERMINED AND HAD WORSTED HIM IN A VERY IMPORTANT CONTEST. HOW WOULD IT BE FROM NOW ON. HE WALKED THE FLOOR OF HIS LITTLE OFFICE AND LATER THAT OF HIS ROOM PUTTING ONE THING AND ANOTHER TOGETHER TO NO AVAIL. MISSUS HURSTWOOD ON THE CONTRARY HAD DECIDED NOT TO LOSE HER ADVANTAGE BY INACTION. NOW THAT SHE HAD PRACTICALLY COWED HIM SHE WOULD FOLLOW UP HER WORK WITH DEMANDS THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF WHICH WOULD MAKE HER WORD LAW IN THE FUTURE. HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE WOULD NOW REGULARLY DEMAND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HE DID. SHE REALLY DID NOT CARE WHETHER HE CAME HOME ANY MORE OR NOT. THE HOUSEHOLD WOULD MOVE ALONG MUCH MORE PLEASANTLY WITHOUT HIM AND SHE COULD DO AS SHE WISHED WITHOUT CONSULTING ANY ONE. NOW SHE PROPOSED TO CONSULT A LAWYER AND HIRE A DETECTIVE. SHE WOULD FIND OUT AT ONCE JUST WHAT ADVANTAGES SHE COULD GAIN. HURSTWOOD WALKED THE FLOOR MENTALLY ARRANGING THE CHIEF POINTS OF HIS SITUATION. SHE HAS THAT PROPERTY IN HER NAME HE KEPT SAYING TO HIMSELF. WHAT A FOOL TRICK THAT WAS CURSE IT WHAT A FOOL MOVE THAT WAS. HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION. IF SHE RAISES A ROW NOW I'LL LOSE THIS THING. THEY WON'T HAVE ME AROUND IF MY NAME GETS IN THE PAPERS MY FRIENDS TOO. HE GREW MORE ANGRY AS HE THOUGHT OF THE TALK ANY ACTION ON HER PART WOULD CREATE. HOW WOULD THE PAPERS TALK ABOUT IT. EVERY MAN HE KNEW WOULD BE WONDERING. HE WOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN AND DENY AND MAKE A GENERAL MARK OF HIMSELF. THEN MOY WOULD COME AND CONFER WITH HIM AND THERE WOULD BE THE DEVIL TO PAY. MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROW MOISTENED. HE SAW NO SOLUTION OF ANYTHING NOT A LOOPHOLE LEFT. THROUGH ALL THIS THOUGHTS OF CARRIE FLASHED UPON HIM AND THE APPROACHING AFFAIR OF SATURDAY. TANGLED AS ALL HIS MATTERS WERE HE DID NOT WORRY OVER THAT. IT WAS THE ONE PLEASING THING IN THIS WHOLE ROUT OF TROUBLE. HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR CARRIE WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY. HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL. HE SAW ONLY HER PRETTY FACE AND NEAT FIGURE AND WONDERED WHY LIFE WAS NOT ARRANGED SO THAT SUCH JOY AS HE FOUND WITH HER COULD BE STEADILY MAINTAINED. HOW MUCH MORE PLEASANT IT WOULD BE. THEN HE WOULD TAKE UP HIS WIFE'S THREAT AGAIN AND THE WRINKLES AND MOISTURE WOULD RETURN. IN THE MORNING HE CAME OVER FROM THE HOTEL AND OPENED HIS MAIL BUT THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY RUN. FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED. HE BEGAN TO FEEL THE APPETITE THAT HAD BEEN WANTING BEFORE HE HAD REACHED THE OFFICE AND DECIDED BEFORE GOING OUT TO THE PARK TO MEET CARRIE TO DROP IN AT THE GRAND PACIFIC AND HAVE A POT OF COFFEE AND SOME ROLLS. WHILE THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALISED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS. IF HE COULD ONLY GET PLENTY OF TIME TO THINK PERHAPS SOMETHING WOULD TURN UP. SURELY SURELY THIS THING WOULD NOT DRIFT ALONG TO CATASTROPHE AND HE NOT FIND A WAY OUT. HIS SPIRITS FELL HOWEVER WHEN UPON REACHING THE PARK HE WAITED AND WAITED AND CARRIE DID NOT COME. COULD SOMETHING HAVE HAPPENED OUT THERE TO KEEP HER AWAY. COULD SHE HAVE BEEN REACHED BY HIS WIFE SURELY NOT. SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DROUET THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT. HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RUMINATED AND THEN DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING. SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING. THAT WAS WHY NO LETTER NOTIFYING HIM HAD COME. HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE. AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DREARILY HEADED FOR THE MADISON CAR
