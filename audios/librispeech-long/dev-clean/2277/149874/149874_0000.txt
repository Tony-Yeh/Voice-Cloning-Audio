MINNIE'S FLAT AS THE ONE FLOOR RESIDENT APARTMENTS WERE THEN BEING CALLED WAS IN A PART OF WEST VAN BUREN STREET INHABITED BY FAMILIES OF LABOURERS AND CLERKS MEN WHO HAD COME AND WERE STILL COMING WITH THE RUSH OF POPULATION POURING IN AT THE RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR. IT WAS ON THE THIRD FLOOR THE FRONT WINDOWS LOOKING DOWN INTO THE STREET WHERE AT NIGHT THE LIGHTS OF GROCERY STORES WERE SHINING AND CHILDREN WERE PLAYING. TO CARRIE THE SOUND OF THE LITTLE BELLS UPON THE HORSE CARS AS THEY TINKLED IN AND OUT OF HEARING WAS AS PLEASING AS IT WAS NOVEL. SHE GAZED INTO THE LIGHTED STREET WHEN MINNIE BROUGHT HER INTO THE FRONT ROOM AND WONDERED AT THE SOUNDS THE MOVEMENT THE MURMUR OF THE VAST CITY WHICH STRETCHED FOR MILES AND MILES IN EVERY DIRECTION. MISSUS HANSON AFTER THE FIRST GREETINGS WERE OVER GAVE CARRIE THE BABY AND PROCEEDED TO GET SUPPER. HER HUSBAND ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS AND SAT DOWN TO READ THE EVENING PAPER. HE WAS A SILENT MAN AMERICAN BORN OF A SWEDE FATHER AND NOW EMPLOYED AS A CLEANER OF REFRIGERATOR CARS AT THE STOCK YARDS. TO HIM THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HIS WIFE'S SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE. HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE DID NOT AFFECT HIM ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. HIS ONE OBSERVATION TO THE POINT WAS CONCERNING THE CHANCES OF WORK IN CHICAGO. IT'S A BIG PLACE HE SAID. YOU CAN GET IN SOMEWHERE IN A FEW DAYS EVERYBODY DOES. IT HAD BEEN TACITLY UNDERSTOOD BEFOREHAND THAT SHE WAS TO GET WORK AND PAY HER BOARD. HE WAS OF A CLEAN SAVING DISPOSITION AND HAD ALREADY PAID A NUMBER OF MONTHLY INSTALMENTS ON TWO LOTS FAR OUT ON THE WEST SIDE. HIS AMBITION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THEM. IN THE INTERVAL WHICH MARKED THE PREPARATION OF THE MEAL CARRIE FOUND TIME TO STUDY THE FLAT. SHE HAD SOME SLIGHT GIFT OF OBSERVATION AND THAT SENSE SO RICH IN EVERY WOMAN INTUITION. SHE FELT THE DRAG OF A LEAN AND NARROW LIFE. THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS WERE DISCORDANTLY PAPERED. THE FLOORS WERE COVERED WITH MATTING AND THE HALL LAID WITH A THIN RAG CARPET. ONE COULD SEE THAT THE FURNITURE WAS OF THAT POOR HURRIEDLY PATCHED TOGETHER QUALITY SOLD BY THE INSTALMENT HOUSES. SHE SAT WITH MINNIE IN THE KITCHEN HOLDING THE BABY UNTIL IT BEGAN TO CRY. THEN SHE WALKED AND SANG TO IT UNTIL HANSON DISTURBED IN HIS READING CAME AND TOOK IT. A PLEASANT SIDE TO HIS NATURE CAME OUT HERE HE WAS PATIENT. ONE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN HIS OFFSPRING. NOW NOW HE SAID WALKING THERE THERE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SWEDISH ACCENT NOTICEABLE IN HIS VOICE. YOU'LL WANT TO SEE THE CITY FIRST WON'T YOU SAID MINNIE WHEN THEY WERE EATING. WELL WE'LL GO OUT SUNDAY AND SEE LINCOLN PARK. CARRIE NOTICED THAT HANSON HAD SAID NOTHING TO THIS. HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE. WELL SHE SAID I THINK I'LL LOOK AROUND TO MORROW I'VE GOT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AND IT WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE WHICH WAY IS THE BUSINESS PART. MINNIE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF. IT'S THAT WAY HE SAID POINTING EAST THAT'S EAST. THEN HE WENT OFF INTO THE LONGEST SPEECH HE HAD YET INDULGED IN CONCERNING THE LAY OF CHICAGO. YOU'D BETTER LOOK IN THOSE BIG MANUFACTURING HOUSES ALONG FRANKLIN STREET AND JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER HE CONCLUDED LOTS OF GIRLS WORK THERE. YOU COULD GET HOME EASY TOO IT ISN'T VERY FAR. CARRIE NODDED AND ASKED HER SISTER ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. THE LATTER TALKED IN A SUBDUED TONE TELLING THE LITTLE SHE KNEW ABOUT IT WHILE HANSON CONCERNED HIMSELF WITH THE BABY. FINALLY HE JUMPED UP AND HANDED THE CHILD TO HIS WIFE. MINNIE'S MANNER WAS ONE OF TRAINED INDUSTRY AND CARRIE COULD SEE THAT IT WAS A STEADY ROUND OF TOIL WITH HER. SHE BEGAN TO SEE THAT HER RELATIONS WITH DROUET WOULD HAVE TO BE ABANDONED HE COULD NOT COME HERE. SHE READ FROM THE MANNER OF HANSON IN THE SUBDUED AIR OF MINNIE AND INDEED THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE OF THE FLAT A SETTLED OPPOSITION TO ANYTHING SAVE A CONSERVATIVE ROUND OF TOIL
