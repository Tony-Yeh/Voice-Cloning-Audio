THE CITY HAD LAID MILES AND MILES OF STREETS AND SEWERS THROUGH REGIONS WHERE PERHAPS ONE SOLITARY HOUSE STOOD OUT ALONE A PIONEER OF THE POPULOUS WAYS TO BE. THERE WERE REGIONS OPEN TO THE SWEEPING WINDS AND RAIN WHICH WERE YET LIGHTED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT WITH LONG BLINKING LINES OF GAS LAMPS FLUTTERING IN THE WIND. NARROW BOARD WALKS EXTENDED OUT PASSING HERE A HOUSE AND THERE A STORE AT FAR INTERVALS EVENTUALLY ENDING ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE. IN THE CENTRAL PORTION WAS THE VAST WHOLESALE AND SHOPPING DISTRICT TO WHICH THE UNINFORMED SEEKER FOR WORK USUALLY DRIFTED. IT WAS A CHARACTERISTIC OF CHICAGO THEN AND ONE NOT GENERALLY SHARED BY OTHER CITIES THAT INDIVIDUAL FIRMS OF ANY PRETENSION OCCUPIED INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS. THE PRESENCE OF AMPLE GROUND MADE THIS POSSIBLE. IT GAVE AN IMPOSING APPEARANCE TO MOST OF THE WHOLESALE HOUSES WHOSE OFFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STREET. THE CASUAL WANDERER COULD SEE AS HE PASSED A POLISHED ARRAY OF OFFICE FIXTURES MUCH FROSTED GLASS CLERKS HARD AT WORK AND GENTEEL BUSINESS MEN IN NOBBY SUITS AND CLEAN LINEN LOUNGING ABOUT OR SITTING IN GROUPS. POLISHED BRASS OR NICKEL SIGNS AT THE SQUARE STONE ENTRANCES ANNOUNCED THE FIRM AND THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS IN RATHER NEAT AND RESERVED TERMS. THE ENTIRE METROPOLITAN CENTRE POSSESSED A HIGH AND MIGHTY AIR CALCULATED TO OVERAWE AND ABASH THE COMMON APPLICANT AND TO MAKE THE GULF BETWEEN POVERTY AND SUCCESS SEEM BOTH WIDE AND DEEP. INTO THIS IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL REGION THE TIMID CARRIE WENT. SHE WALKED EAST ALONG VAN BUREN STREET THROUGH A REGION OF LESSENING IMPORTANCE UNTIL IT DETERIORATED INTO A MASS OF SHANTIES AND COAL YARDS AND FINALLY VERGED UPON THE RIVER. SHE WALKED BRAVELY FORWARD LED BY AN HONEST DESIRE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT AND DELAYED AT EVERY STEP BY THE INTEREST OF THE UNFOLDING SCENE AND A SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS AMID SO MUCH EVIDENCE OF POWER AND FORCE WHICH SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND. THESE VAST BUILDINGS WHAT WERE THEY. THESE STRANGE ENERGIES AND HUGE INTERESTS FOR WHAT PURPOSES WERE THEY THERE. SHE COULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF A LITTLE STONE CUTTER'S YARD AT COLUMBIA CITY CARVING LITTLE PIECES OF MARBLE FOR INDIVIDUAL USE BUT WHEN THE YARDS OF SOME HUGE STONE CORPORATION CAME INTO VIEW FILLED WITH SPUR TRACKS AND FLAT CARS TRANSPIERCED BY DOCKS FROM THE RIVER AND TRAVERSED OVERHEAD BY IMMENSE TRUNDLING CRANES OF WOOD AND STEEL IT LOST ALL SIGNIFICANCE IN HER LITTLE WORLD. IT WAS SO WITH THE VAST RAILROAD YARDS WITH THE CROWDED ARRAY OF VESSELS SHE SAW AT THE RIVER AND THE HUGE FACTORIES OVER THE WAY LINING THE WATER'S EDGE. THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOWS SHE COULD SEE THE FIGURES OF MEN AND WOMEN IN WORKING APRONS MOVING BUSILY ABOUT. THE GREAT STREETS WERE WALL LINED MYSTERIES TO HER THE VAST OFFICES STRANGE MAZES WHICH CONCERNED FAR OFF INDIVIDUALS OF IMPORTANCE. SHE COULD ONLY THINK OF PEOPLE CONNECTED WITH THEM AS COUNTING MONEY DRESSING MAGNIFICENTLY AND RIDING IN CARRIAGES
