DURING THE WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS JAKE WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON OF OUR HOUSEHOLD FOR HE WAS TO GO TO TOWN AND DO ALL OUR CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. BUT ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF DECEMBER THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL. THE FLAKES CAME DOWN SO THICKLY THAT FROM THE SITTING ROOM WINDOWS I COULD NOT SEE BEYOND THE WINDMILL ITS FRAME LOOKED DIM AND GRAY UNSUBSTANTIAL LIKE A SHADOW. THE SNOW DID NOT STOP FALLING ALL DAY OR DURING THE NIGHT THAT FOLLOWED. THE COLD WAS NOT SEVERE BUT THE STORM WAS QUIET AND RESISTLESS. THE MEN COULD NOT GO FARTHER THAN THE BARNS AND CORRAL. THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GREASING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLAITING WHIPLASHES. JAKE WAS SURE HE COULD GET THROUGH ON HORSEBACK AND BRING HOME OUR THINGS IN SADDLE BAGS BUT GRANDFATHER TOLD HIM THE ROADS WOULD BE OBLITERATED AND A NEWCOMER IN THE COUNTRY WOULD BE LOST TEN TIMES OVER. ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN. WE DECIDED TO HAVE A COUNTRY CHRISTMAS WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM TOWN. I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YULKA AND ANTONIA EVEN YULKA WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW. GRANDMOTHER TOOK ME INTO THE ICE COLD STOREROOM WHERE SHE HAD SOME BOLTS OF GINGHAM AND SHEETING. SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SEWED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK. WE BOUND IT BETWEEN PASTEBOARDS WHICH I COVERED WITH BRILLIANT CALICO REPRESENTING SCENES FROM A CIRCUS. FOR TWO DAYS I SAT AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE PASTING THIS BOOK FULL OF PICTURES FOR YULKA. WE HAD FILES OF THOSE GOOD OLD FAMILY MAGAZINES WHICH USED TO PUBLISH COLORED LITHOGRAPHS OF POPULAR PAINTINGS AND I WAS ALLOWED TO USE SOME OF THESE. I TOOK NAPOLEON ANNOUNCING THE DIVORCE TO JOSEPHINE FOR MY FRONTISPIECE. ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY. FUCHS GOT OUT THE OLD CANDLE MOULDS AND MADE TALLOW CANDLES. GRANDMOTHER HUNTED UP HER FANCY CAKE CUTTERS AND BAKED GINGERBREAD MEN AND ROOSTERS WHICH WE DECORATED WITH BURNT SUGAR AND RED CINNAMON DROPS. ON THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS JAKE PACKED THE THINGS WE WERE SENDING TO THE SHIMERDAS IN HIS SADDLE BAGS AND SET OFF ON GRANDFATHER'S GRAY GELDING. WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME. THAT AFTERNOON I WATCHED LONG AND EAGERLY FROM THE SITTING ROOM WINDOW. AT LAST I SAW A DARK SPOT MOVING ON THE WEST HILL BESIDE THE HALF BURIED CORNFIELD WHERE THE SKY WAS TAKING ON A COPPERY FLUSH FROM THE SUN THAT DID NOT QUITE BREAK THROUGH. I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JAKE. WHEN I GOT TO THE POND I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS BRINGING IN A LITTLE CEDAR TREE ACROSS HIS POMMEL. HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM. BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE. AFTER SUPPER WE ALL GATHERED THERE AND EVEN GRANDFATHER READING HIS PAPER BY THE TABLE LOOKED UP WITH FRIENDLY INTEREST NOW AND THEN. THE CEDAR WAS ABOUT FIVE FEET HIGH AND VERY SHAPELY. WE HUNG IT WITH THE GINGERBREAD ANIMALS STRINGS OF POPCORN AND BITS OF CANDLE WHICH FUCHS HAD FITTED INTO PASTEBOARD SOCKETS. ITS REAL SPLENDORS HOWEVER CAME FROM THE MOST UNLIKELY PLACE IN THE WORLD FROM OTTO'S COWBOY TRUNK. FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLORED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE. THEY HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM YEAR AFTER YEAR BY HIS OLD MOTHER IN AUSTRIA. OUR TREE BECAME THE TALKING TREE OF THE FAIRY TALE LEGENDS AND STORIES NESTLED LIKE BIRDS IN ITS BRANCHES
