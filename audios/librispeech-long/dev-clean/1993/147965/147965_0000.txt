GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT. MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL. HE READ THE CHAPTERS FROM SAINT MATTHEW ABOUT THE BIRTH OF CHRIST AND AS WE LISTENED IT ALL SEEMED LIKE SOMETHING THAT HAD HAPPENED LATELY AND NEAR AT HAND. IN HIS PRAYER HE THANKED THE LORD FOR THE FIRST CHRISTMAS AND FOR ALL THAT IT HAD MEANT TO THE WORLD EVER SINCE. HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US. GRANDFATHER'S PRAYERS WERE OFTEN VERY INTERESTING. HE HAD THE GIFT OF SIMPLE AND MOVING EXPRESSION. BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE. HIS PRAYERS REFLECTED WHAT HE WAS THINKING ABOUT AT THE TIME AND IT WAS CHIEFLY THROUGH THEM THAT WE GOT TO KNOW HIS FEELINGS AND HIS VIEWS ABOUT THINGS. AFTER WE SAT DOWN TO OUR WAFFLES AND SAUSAGE JAKE TOLD US HOW PLEASED THE SHIMERDAS HAD BEEN WITH THEIR PRESENTS EVEN AMBROSCH WAS FRIENDLY AND WENT TO THE CREEK WITH HIM TO CUT THE CHRISTMAS TREE. IT WAS A SOFT GRAY DAY OUTSIDE WITH HEAVY CLOUDS WORKING ACROSS THE SKY AND OCCASIONAL SQUALLS OF SNOW. THERE WERE ALWAYS ODD JOBS TO BE DONE ABOUT THE BARN ON HOLIDAYS AND THE MEN WERE BUSY UNTIL AFTERNOON. THEN JAKE AND I PLAYED DOMINOES WHILE OTTO WROTE A LONG LETTER HOME TO HIS MOTHER. HE ALWAYS WROTE TO HER ON CHRISTMAS DAY HE SAID NO MATTER WHERE HE WAS AND NO MATTER HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN SINCE HIS LAST LETTER. ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM. HE WOULD WRITE FOR A WHILE THEN SIT IDLE HIS CLENCHED FIST LYING ON THE TABLE HIS EYES FOLLOWING THE PATTERN OF THE OILCLOTH. HE SPOKE AND WROTE HIS OWN LANGUAGE SO SELDOM THAT IT CAME TO HIM AWKWARDLY. AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMERDA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED. HE HAD COME TO THANK US FOR THE PRESENTS AND FOR ALL GRANDMOTHER'S KINDNESS TO HIS FAMILY. THIS FEELING SEEMED COMPLETELY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF MISTER SHIMERDA. I SUPPOSE IN THE CROWDED CLUTTER OF THEIR CAVE THE OLD MAN HAD COME TO BELIEVE THAT PEACE AND ORDER HAD VANISHED FROM THE EARTH OR EXISTED ONLY IN THE OLD WORLD HE HAD LEFT SO FAR BEHIND. HE SAT STILL AND PASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS. HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN. GRANDMOTHER INSISTED ON HIS DRINKING A GLASS OF VIRGINIA APPLE BRANDY AFTER HIS LONG WALK IN THE COLD AND WHEN A FAINT FLUSH CAME UP IN HIS CHEEKS HIS FEATURES MIGHT HAVE BEEN CUT OUT OF A SHELL THEY WERE SO TRANSPARENT. MISTER SHIMERDA ROSE CROSSED HIMSELF AND QUIETLY KNELT DOWN BEFORE THE TREE HIS HEAD SUNK FORWARD. HIS LONG BODY FORMED A LETTER S I SAW GRANDMOTHER LOOK APPREHENSIVELY AT GRANDFATHER. HE WAS RATHER NARROW IN RELIGIOUS MATTERS AND SOMETIMES SPOKE OUT AND HURT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS. WHEN HIS DEEP SEEING EYES RESTED ON ME I FELT AS IF HE WERE LOOKING FAR AHEAD INTO THE FUTURE FOR ME DOWN THE ROAD I WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL. AT NINE O'CLOCK MISTER SHIMERDA LIGHTED ONE OF OUR LANTERNS AND PUT ON HIS OVERCOAT AND FUR COLLAR. HE STOOD IN THE LITTLE ENTRY HALL THE LANTERN AND HIS FUR CAP UNDER HIS ARM SHAKING HANDS WITH US. WHEN HE TOOK GRANDMOTHER'S HAND HE BENT OVER IT AS HE ALWAYS DID AND SAID SLOWLY GOOD WO MAN. HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK. AS WE TURNED BACK TO THE SITTING ROOM GRANDFATHER LOOKED AT ME SEARCHINGLY
