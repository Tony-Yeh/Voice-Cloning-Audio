THUD THUD WE COULD HEAR THE IMPACT OF THEIR GREAT HEADS AND THEIR BELLOWING SHOOK THE PANS ON THE KITCHEN SHELVES. PRETTY SOON THE FAT STEERS TOOK IT UP AND BEGAN BUTTING AND HORNING EACH OTHER. CLEARLY THE AFFAIR HAD TO BE STOPPED. THE BIG STORM OF THE WINTER BEGAN ON MY ELEVENTH BIRTHDAY THE TWENTIETH OF JANUARY. WHEN I WENT DOWN TO BREAKFAST THAT MORNING JAKE AND OTTO CAME IN WHITE AS SNOW MEN BEATING THEIR HANDS AND STAMPING THEIR FEET. THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BOISTEROUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME CALLING. YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AND NO MISTAKE. THEY WAS A FULL GROWN BLIZZARD ORDERED FOR YOU. ALL DAY THE STORM WENT ON. THE SNOW DID NOT FALL THIS TIME IT SIMPLY SPILLED OUT OF HEAVEN LIKE THOUSANDS OF FEATHER BEDS BEING EMPTIED. NEXT DAY OUR MEN HAD TO SHOVEL UNTIL NOON TO REACH THE BARN AND THE SNOW WAS STILL FALLING. THERE HAD NOT BEEN SUCH A STORM IN THE TEN YEARS MY GRANDFATHER HAD LIVED IN NEBRASKA. WE COULD NOT SO MUCH AS SEE THE CORRALS BUT WE KNEW THE STEERS WERE OVER THERE HUDDLED TOGETHER UNDER THE NORTH BANK. OUR FEROCIOUS BULLS SUBDUED ENOUGH BY THIS TIME WERE PROBABLY WARMING EACH OTHER'S BACKS. THIS'LL TAKE THE BILE OUT OF EM FUCHS REMARKED GLEEFULLY. AT NOON THAT DAY THE HENS HAD NOT BEEN HEARD FROM. AFTER DINNER JAKE AND OTTO THEIR DAMP CLOTHES NOW DRIED ON THEM STRETCHED THEIR STIFF ARMS AND PLUNGED AGAIN INTO THE DRIFTS. THEY MADE A TUNNEL UNDER THE SNOW TO THE HENHOUSE WITH WALLS SO SOLID THAT GRANDMOTHER AND I COULD WALK BACK AND FORTH IN IT. WE FOUND THE CHICKENS ASLEEP PERHAPS THEY THOUGHT NIGHT HAD COME TO STAY. ONE OLD ROOSTER WAS STIRRING ABOUT PECKING AT THE SOLID LUMP OF ICE IN THEIR WATER TIN. WHEN WE FLASHED THE LANTERN IN THEIR EYES THE HENS SET UP A GREAT CACKLING AND FLEW ABOUT CLUMSILY SCATTERING DOWN FEATHERS. BY FIVE O'CLOCK THE CHORES WERE DONE JUST WHEN IT WAS TIME TO BEGIN THEM ALL OVER AGAIN
