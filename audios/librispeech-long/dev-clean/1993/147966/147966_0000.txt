THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEAR'S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY SLUSH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER. THE SOFT BLACK EARTH STOOD OUT IN PATCHES ALONG THE ROADSIDES. I RESUMED ALL MY CHORES CARRIED IN THE COBS AND WOOD AND WATER AND SPENT THE AFTERNOONS AT THE BARN WATCHING JAKE SHELL CORN WITH A HAND SHELLER. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE. IN THE KITCHEN SHE CAUGHT UP AN IRON POT THAT STOOD ON THE BACK OF THE STOVE AND SAID YOU GOT MANY SHIMERDAS NO GOT. I THOUGHT IT WEAK MINDED OF GRANDMOTHER TO GIVE THE POT TO HER. AFTER DINNER WHEN SHE WAS HELPING TO WASH THE DISHES SHE SAID TOSSING HER HEAD YOU GOT MANY THINGS FOR COOK. IF I GOT ALL THINGS LIKE YOU I MAKE MUCH BETTER. SHE WAS A CONCEITED BOASTFUL OLD THING AND EVEN MISFORTUNE COULD NOT HUMBLE HER. I WAS SO ANNOYED THAT I FELT COLDLY EVEN TOWARD ANTONIA AND LISTENED UNSYMPATHETICALLY WHEN SHE TOLD ME HER FATHER WAS NOT WELL. MY PAPA SAD FOR THE OLD COUNTRY HE NOT LOOK GOOD. HE NEVER MAKE MUSIC ANY MORE. AT HOME HE PLAY VIOLIN ALL THE TIME FOR WEDDINGS AND FOR DANCE HERE NEVER. WHEN I BEG HIM FOR PLAY HE SHAKE HIS HEAD NO. SOME DAYS HE TAKE HIS VIOLIN OUT OF HIS BOX AND MAKE WITH HIS FINGERS ON THE STRINGS LIKE THIS BUT NEVER HE MAKE THE MUSIC HE DON'T LIKE THIS KAWN TREE. HE NOT WANT TO COME NEV ER SHE BURST OUT MY MAMENKA MAKE HIM COME. ALL THE TIME SHE SAY AMERICA BIG COUNTRY MUCH MONEY MUCH LAND FOR MY BOYS MUCH HUSBAND FOR MY GIRLS. MY PAPA HE CRY FOR LEAVE HIS OLD FRIENDS WHAT MAKE MUSIC WITH HIM. HE LOVE VERY MUCH THE MAN WHAT PLAY THE LONG HORN LIKE THIS SHE INDICATED A SLIDE TROMBONE. THEY GO TO SCHOOL TOGETHER AND ARE FRIENDS FROM BOYS. BUT MY MAMA SHE WANT AMBROSCH FOR BE RICH WITH MANY CATTLE. YOUR MAMA I SAID ANGRILY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS. YOUR GRANDFATHER IS RICH SHE RETORTED FIERCELY WHY HE NOT HELP MY PAPA. AMBROSCH BE RICH TOO AFTER WHILE AND HE PAY BACK HE IS VERY SMART BOY. FOR AMBROSCH MY MAMA COME HERE. AMBROSCH WAS CONSIDERED THE IMPORTANT PERSON IN THE FAMILY. MISSUS SHIMERDA AND ANTONIA ALWAYS DEFERRED TO HIM THOUGH HE WAS OFTEN SURLY WITH THEM AND CONTEMPTUOUS TOWARD HIS FATHER. AMBROSCH AND HIS MOTHER HAD EVERYTHING THEIR OWN WAY. THOUGH ANTONIA LOVED HER FATHER MORE THAN SHE DID ANY ONE ELSE SHE STOOD IN AWE OF HER ELDER BROTHER. AFTER I WATCHED ANTONIA AND HER MOTHER GO OVER THE HILL ON THEIR MISERABLE HORSE CARRYING OUR IRON POT WITH THEM I TURNED TO GRANDMOTHER WHO HAD TAKEN UP HER DARNING AND SAID I HOPED THAT SNOOPING OLD WOMAN WOULD N'T COME TO SEE US ANY MORE. GRANDMOTHER CHUCKLED AND DROVE HER BRIGHT NEEDLE ACROSS A HOLE IN OTTO'S SOCK. SHE'S NOT OLD JIM THOUGH I EXPECT SHE SEEMS OLD TO YOU. NO I WOULD N'T MOURN IF SHE NEVER CAME AGAIN. BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRAITS POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN EM. IT MAKES A WOMAN GRASPING TO SEE HER CHILDREN WANT FOR THINGS. NOW READ ME A CHAPTER IN THE PRINCE OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID LET'S FORGET THE BOHEMIANS. WE HAD THREE WEEKS OF THIS MILD OPEN WEATHER. THE CATTLE IN THE CORRAL ATE CORN ALMOST AS FAST AS THE MEN COULD SHELL IT FOR THEM AND WE HOPED THEY WOULD BE READY FOR AN EARLY MARKET. ONE MORNING THE TWO BIG BULLS GLADSTONE AND BRIGHAM YOUNG THOUGHT SPRING HAD COME AND THEY BEGAN TO TEASE AND BUTT AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE BARBED WIRE THAT SEPARATED THEM SOON THEY GOT ANGRY. THEY BELLOWED AND PAWED UP THE SOFT EARTH WITH THEIR HOOFS ROLLING THEIR EYES AND TOSSING THEIR HEADS. EACH WITHDREW TO A FAR CORNER OF HIS OWN CORRAL AND THEN THEY MADE FOR EACH OTHER AT A GALLOP
