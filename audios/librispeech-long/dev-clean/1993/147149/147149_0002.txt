OH JEM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU. JEM FELT A STRANGE LEAP OF JOY IN HIS HEART AND KNEW THE POWER SHE HAD OF COMFORTING HIM. HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HAND'S TOUCH THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR. DON'T JEM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF. HE COULD NOT CONTAIN HIMSELF. HE TOOK HER HAND IN HIS FIRM YET TREMBLING GRASP AND SAID IN TONES THAT INSTANTLY PRODUCED A REVULSION IN HER MOOD. MARY I ALMOST LOATHE MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PAST AND GONE AND MARY AS SHE TRIED TO RELEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED. SHE DID KNOW HE WAS RIGHT THERE. BUT AS HE TURNED TO CATCH A LOOK AT HER SWEET FACE HE SAW THAT IT EXPRESSED UNFEIGNED DISTRESS ALMOST AMOUNTING TO VEXATION A DREAD OF HIM THAT HE THOUGHT WAS ALMOST REPUGNANCE. HE LET HER HAND GO AND SHE QUICKLY WENT AWAY TO ALICE'S SIDE. PARTLY TO RELIEVE HER FROM HIS PRESENCE AND PARTLY FROM NATURAL DESIRE AND PARTLY PERHAPS FROM A PENITENT WISH TO SHARE TO THE UTMOST HIS PARENTS SORROW HE SOON WENT UP STAIRS TO THE CHAMBER OF DEATH. MARY MECHANICALLY HELPED ALICE IN ALL THE DUTIES SHE PERFORMED THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THAT LONG NIGHT BUT SHE DID NOT SEE JEM AGAIN. HE REMAINED UP STAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED AND QUIET STREETS TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR. SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JEM AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN. THEY HAD ANOTHER MORN THAN OURS. MARY LAY DOWN ON HER BED IN HER CLOTHES AND WHETHER IT WAS THIS OR THE BROAD DAYLIGHT THAT POURED IN THROUGH THE SKY WINDOW OR WHETHER IT WAS OVER EXCITEMENT IT WAS LONG BEFORE SHE COULD CATCH A WINK OF SLEEP. HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JEM'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY. IT'S VERY HARD ON ME FOR FATHER AND GEORGE WILSON ARE OLD FRIENDS AND JEM AND I HA KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE QUITE CHILDREN. I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE'S DOWNCAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WI HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM. I DON'T CARE FOR HIM AND YET UNLESS I'M ALWAYS WATCHING MYSELF I'M SPEAKING TO HIM IN A LOVING VOICE. I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR I EITHER CHECK MYSELF TILL I'M DOWNRIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF. AND I'M AS GOOD AS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FAR HANDSOMER THAN JEM ONLY I THINK I LIKE JEM'S FACE BEST FOR ALL THAT LIKING'S LIKING AND THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT. WELL WHEN I'M MISSUS HARRY CARSON MAY HAPPEN I CAN PUT SOME GOOD FORTUNE IN JEM'S WAY. BUT WILL HE THANK ME FOR IT. HE'S RATHER SAVAGE AT TIMES THAT I CAN SEE AND PERHAPS KINDNESS FROM ME WHEN I'M ANOTHER'S WILL ONLY GO AGAINST THE GRAIN. I'LL NOT PLAGUE MYSELF WI THINKING ANY MORE ABOUT HIM THAT I WON'T
