SO SHE TURNED ON HER PILLOW AND FELL ASLEEP AND DREAMT OF WHAT WAS OFTEN IN HER WAKING THOUGHTS OF THE DAY WHEN SHE SHOULD RIDE FROM CHURCH IN HER CARRIAGE WITH WEDDING BELLS RINGING AND TAKE UP HER ASTONISHED FATHER AND DRIVE AWAY FROM THE OLD DIM WORK A DAY COURT FOR EVER TO LIVE IN A GRAND HOUSE WHERE HER FATHER SHOULD HAVE NEWSPAPERS AND PAMPHLETS AND PIPES AND MEAT DINNERS EVERY DAY AND ALL DAY LONG IF HE LIKED. SUCH THOUGHTS MINGLED IN HER PREDILECTION FOR THE HANDSOME YOUNG MISTER CARSON WHO UNFETTERED BY WORK HOURS LET SCARCELY A DAY PASS WITHOUT CONTRIVING A MEETING WITH THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE MILLINER HE HAD FIRST SEEN WHILE LOUNGING IN A SHOP WHERE HIS SISTERS WERE MAKING SOME PURCHASES AND AFTERWARDS NEVER RESTED TILL HE HAD FREELY THOUGH RESPECTFULLY MADE HER ACQUAINTANCE IN HER DAILY WALKS. HE WAS TO USE HIS OWN EXPRESSION TO HIMSELF QUITE INFATUATED BY HER AND WAS RESTLESS EACH DAY TILL THE TIME CAME WHEN HE HAD A CHANCE AND OF LATE MORE THAN A CHANCE OF MEETING HER. THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWORLDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SIMMONDS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES. MARY WAS AMBITIOUS AND DID NOT FAVOUR MISTER CARSON THE LESS BECAUSE HE WAS RICH AND A GENTLEMAN. THE OLD LEAVEN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT ESTHER FERMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE. SUCH IS THE CONTRARINESS OF THE HUMAN HEART FROM EVE DOWNWARDS THAT WE ALL IN OUR OLD ADAM STATE FANCY THINGS FORBIDDEN SWEETEST. SO MARY DWELT UPON AND ENJOYED THE IDEA OF SOME DAY BECOMING A LADY AND DOING ALL THE ELEGANT NOTHINGS APPERTAINING TO LADYHOOD. IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMMONDS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESSMAKER. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO HER TO HEAR THE GENERAL ADMIRATION OF THE TWO ELDER MISS CARSONS ACKNOWLEDGED BEAUTIES IN BALL ROOM AND STREET ON HORSEBACK AND ON FOOT AND TO THINK OF THE TIME WHEN SHE SHOULD RIDE AND WALK WITH THEM IN LOVING SISTERHOOD. BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DISHEARTENED GLOOMY PERSON. HOW SHE WOULD SURROUND HIM WITH EVERY COMFORT SHE COULD DEVISE OF COURSE HE WAS TO LIVE WITH THEM TILL HE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE RICHES TO BE VERY PLEASANT THINGS AND BLESS HIS LADY DAUGHTER. EVERY ONE WHO HAD SHOWN HER KINDNESS IN HER LOW ESTATE SHOULD THEN BE REPAID A HUNDRED FOLD. MEANWHILE HER WORDS OR EVEN MORE HER TONES WOULD MAINTAIN THEIR HOLD ON JEM WILSON'S MEMORY. A THRILL WOULD YET COME OVER HIM WHEN HE REMEMBERED HOW HER HAND HAD RESTED ON HIS ARM
