JEM WILSON'S REPULSE. HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GARNERED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND OH. WHAT BANKRUPTS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSELESS CREDITOR SEIZES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS. THE GHOUL LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BAULKED OF ITS PREY. THE WIDOW HAD RECLAIMED HER CHILDREN HER NEIGHBOURS IN THE GOOD SAMARITAN SENSE OF THE WORD HAD PAID HER LITTLE ARREARS OF RENT AND MADE HER A FEW SHILLINGS BEFOREHAND WITH THE WORLD. SHE DETERMINED TO FLIT FROM THAT CELLAR TO ANOTHER LESS FULL OF PAINFUL ASSOCIATIONS LESS HAUNTED BY MOURNFUL MEMORIES. THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOKE CLAYPOLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCKINGHAMSHIRE PARISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT. SO FOOD FOR FOUR MOUTHS WAS ALL SHE WAS NOW REQUIRED TO FIND ONLY FOR THREE SHE WOULD HAVE SAID FOR HERSELF AND THE UNWEANED CHILD WERE BUT RECKONED AS ONE IN HER CALCULATION. SO SHE TOOK IN SOME LITTLE CHILDREN TO NURSE WHO BROUGHT THEIR DAILY FOOD WITH THEM WHICH SHE COOKED FOR THEM WITHOUT WRONGING THEIR HELPLESSNESS OF A CRUMB AND WHEN SHE HAD RESTORED THEM TO THEIR MOTHERS AT NIGHT SHE SET TO WORK AT PLAIN SEWING SEAM AND GUSSET AND BAND AND SAT THINKING HOW SHE MIGHT BEST CHEAT THE FACTORY INSPECTOR AND PERSUADE HIM THAT HER STRONG BIG HUNGRY BEN WAS ABOVE THIRTEEN. HER PLAN OF LIVING WAS SO FAR ARRANGED WHEN SHE HEARD WITH KEEN SORROW THAT WILSON'S TWIN LADS WERE ILL OF THE FEVER. THEY HAD NEVER BEEN STRONG. THEY WERE LIKE MANY A PAIR OF TWINS AND SEEMED TO HAVE BUT ONE LIFE DIVIDED BETWEEN THEM. ONE LIFE ONE STRENGTH AND IN THIS INSTANCE I MIGHT ALMOST SAY ONE BRAIN FOR THEY WERE HELPLESS GENTLE SILLY CHILDREN BUT NOT THE LESS DEAR TO THEIR PARENTS AND TO THEIR STRONG ACTIVE MANLY ELDER BROTHER. STILL WANT HAD NEVER YET COME IN AT THE DOOR TO MAKE LOVE FOR THESE INNOCENTS FLY OUT AT THE WINDOW. NOR WAS THIS THE CASE EVEN NOW WHEN JEM WILSON'S EARNINGS AND HIS MOTHER'S OCCASIONAL CHARRINGS WERE BARELY SUFFICIENT TO GIVE ALL THE FAMILY THEIR FILL OF FOOD. BUT WHEN THE TWINS AFTER AILING MANY DAYS AND CARING LITTLE FOR THEIR MEAT FELL SICK ON THE SAME AFTERNOON WITH THE SAME HEAVY STUPOR OF SUFFERING THE THREE HEARTS THAT LOVED THEM SO EACH FELT THOUGH NONE ACKNOWLEDGED TO THE OTHER THAT THEY HAD LITTLE CHANCE FOR LIFE. MARGARET MET JEM WILSON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME. SHE TOLD MARY OF IT AS SHE ENTERED THE COURT LATE THAT EVENING AND MARY LISTENED WITH SADDENED HEART TO THE STRANGE CONTRAST WHICH SUCH WOEFUL TIDINGS PRESENTED TO THE GAY AND LOVING WORDS SHE HAD BEEN HEARING ON HER WALK HOME. SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR BEING SO MUCH TAKEN UP WITH VISIONS OF THE GOLDEN FUTURE THAT SHE HAD LATELY GONE BUT SELDOM ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS OR OTHER LEISURE TIME TO SEE MISSUS WILSON HER MOTHER'S FRIEND AND WITH HASTY PURPOSE OF AMENDMENT SHE ONLY STAYED TO LEAVE A MESSAGE FOR HER FATHER WITH THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR AND THEN WENT OFF AT A BRISK PACE ON HER WAY TO THE HOUSE OF MOURNING. SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE WILSONS DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN. SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATH LIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN WHICH SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BOARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SOFA SETTEE IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM. OVER THE CHILD WHICH YET BREATHED THE FATHER BENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
