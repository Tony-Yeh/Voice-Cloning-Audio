MARY STEPPED SLOWLY AND LIGHTLY ACROSS TO ALICE. AY POOR LAD GOD HAS TAKEN HIM EARLY MARY. MARY COULD NOT SPEAK SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY IT WAS SO MUCH WORSE THAN SHE EXPECTED. AT LAST SHE VENTURED TO WHISPER. IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THINK YOU. ALICE SHOOK HER HEAD AND TOLD WITH A LOOK THAT SHE BELIEVED THERE WAS NONE. BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UPSTAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WAKENING HIM. WE MUN GET HIM AWAY FROM HIS MOTHER HE CANNOT DIE WHILE SHE'S WISHING HIM. WISHING HIM SAID MARY IN A TONE OF INQUIRY. AY DONNO YE KNOW WHAT WISHING MEANS. THERE'S NONE CAN DIE IN THE ARMS OF THOSE WHO ARE WISHING THEM SORE TO STAY ON EARTH. ALICE AND MARY STOOD BY WITH EYES FIXED ON THE POOR CHILD WHOSE STRUGGLES SEEMED TO INCREASE TILL AT LAST HIS MOTHER SAID WITH A CHOKING VOICE. NATURE'S STRUGGLES WERE SOON EXHAUSTED AND HE BREATHED HIS LITTLE LIFE AWAY IN PEACE. THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT. HER CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS. AGAIN ALICE LAID OUT THE DEAD MARY HELPING WITH REVERENT FEAR. THE FATHER AND MOTHER CARRIED HIM UP STAIRS TO THE BED WHERE HIS LITTLE BROTHER LAY IN CALM REPOSE. MARY AND ALICE DREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME. THEN ALICE BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING. IT WILL BE BAD NEWS FOR JEM POOR FELLOW WHEN HE COMES HOME. WHERE IS HE ASKED MARY. THEY'N GETTEN A LARGE ORDER FRA FORRIN PARTS AND YO KNOW JEM MUN WORK THOUGH HIS HEART'S WELL NIGH BREAKING FOR THESE POOR LADDIES. AGAIN THEY WERE SILENT IN THOUGHT AND AGAIN ALICE SPOKE FIRST. I SOMETIMES THINK THE LORD IS AGAINST PLANNING. WHENE'ER I PLAN OVER MUCH HE IS SURE TO SEND AND MAR ALL MY PLANS AS IF HE WOULD HA ME PUT THE FUTURE INTO HIS HANDS. AFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FULL COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL YO HAN HEARD HOW I'VE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME. LITTLE DID I THINK HOW GOD ALMIGHTY WOULD BAULK ME FOR NOT LEAVING MY DAYS IN HIS HANDS WHO HAD LED ME THROUGH THE WILDERNESS HITHERTO. SO SAYING SHE FELL TO TIDYING THE ROOM REMOVING AS MUCH AS SHE COULD EVERY VESTIGE OF SICKNESS MAKING UP THE FIRE AND SETTING ON THE KETTLE FOR A CUP OF TEA FOR HER SISTER IN LAW WHOSE LOW MOANS AND SOBS WERE OCCASIONALLY HEARD IN THE ROOM BELOW. MARY HELPED HER IN ALL THESE LITTLE OFFICES. BUT JUST NOW HE HARDLY SAW HER HE WENT STRAIGHT UP TO ALICE AND ASKED HOW THE LITTLE CHAPS WERE. THEY HAD BEEN A SHADE BETTER AT DINNER TIME AND HE HAD BEEN WORKING AWAY THROUGH THE LONG AFTERNOON AND FAR INTO THE NIGHT IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY HAD TAKEN THE TURN. HE HAD STOLEN OUT DURING THE HALF HOUR ALLOWED AT THE WORKS FOR TEA TO BUY THEM AN ORANGE OR TWO WHICH NOW PUFFED OUT HIS JACKET POCKET. HE WOULD MAKE HIS AUNT SPEAK HE WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND HER SHAKES OF THE HEAD AND FAST COURSING TEARS. THEY'RE BOTH GONE SAID SHE DEAD. AY POOR FELLOWS. THEY TOOK WORSE ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK. AY LAD BOTH. JEM WENT TO THE CUPBOARD AND QUIETLY EXTRICATED FROM HIS POCKET THE ORANGES HE HAD BOUGHT. BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURDY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY. THE TWO WOMEN WERE FRIGHTENED AS WOMEN ALWAYS ARE ON WITNESSING A MAN'S OVERPOWERING GRIEF. THEY CRIED AFRESH IN COMPANY. MARY'S HEART MELTED WITHIN HER AS SHE WITNESSED JEM'S SORROW AND SHE STEPPED GENTLY UP TO THE CORNER WHERE HE STOOD WITH HIS BACK TURNED TO THEM AND PUTTING HER HAND SOFTLY ON HIS ARM SAID
