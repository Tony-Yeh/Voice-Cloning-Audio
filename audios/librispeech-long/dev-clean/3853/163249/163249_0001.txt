I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT I FEEL VERY SURE THAT SOME WORK WILL BE GIVEN ME INTO WHICH I CAN PUT MY WHOLE HEART AND SOUL AND STRENGTH. I SPOILT MY FIRST CHANCE BUT I KNOW I SHALL HAVE ANOTHER AND WHATEVER IT IS I AM READY TO DO MY BEST AND LIVE OR DIE FOR IT AS GOD WILLS. SO AM I ANSWERED CHRISTIE WITH A VOICE AS EARNEST AND A FACE AS FULL OF HOPEFUL RESOLUTION AS HIS OWN. THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES AND TWINED SMILAX WREATHS HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND DEATH. THE GUN FIRED ONE APRIL MORNING AT FORT SUMTER TOLD MANY MEN LIKE DAVID WHAT THEIR WORK WAS TO BE AND SHOWED MANY WOMEN LIKE CHRISTIE A NEW RIGHT TO CLAIM AND BRAVELY PROVE THEIR FITNESS TO POSSESS. NO NEED TO REPEAT THE STORY OF THE WAR BEGUN THAT DAY IT HAS BEEN SO OFTEN TOLD THAT IT WILL ONLY BE TOUCHED UPON HERE AS ONE OF THE EXPERIENCES OF CHRISTIE'S LIFE AN EXPERIENCE WHICH DID FOR HER WHAT IT DID FOR ALL WHO TOOK A SHARE IN IT AND LOYALLY ACTED THEIR PART. THE NORTH WOKE UP FROM ITS PROSPEROUS LETHARGY AND BEGAN TO STIR WITH THE OMINOUS HUM OF BEES WHEN RUDE HANDS SHAKE THE HIVE. RICH AND POOR WERE PROUD TO PROVE THAT THEY LOVED THEIR LIBERTY BETTER THAN THEIR MONEY OR THEIR LIVES AND THE DESCENDANTS OF THE BRAVE OLD PURITANS WERE WORTHY OF THEIR RACE. MANY SAID IT WILL SOON BE OVER BUT THE WISE MEN WHO HAD WARNED IN VAIN SHOOK THEIR HEADS AS THAT FIRST DISASTROUS SUMMER SHOWED THAT THE TIME FOR COMPROMISE WAS PAST AND THE STERN RECKONING DAY OF ETERNAL JUSTICE WAS AT HAND. TO NO HOME IN THE LAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE. ALL ITS HAPPY PEACE WAS BROKEN EXCITEMENT AND ANXIETY GRIEF AND INDIGNATION BANISHED THE SWEET HOME JOYS AND DARKENED THE FUTURE THAT HAD SEEMED SO CLEAR. DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A SPARK IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION. EACH TRIED TO BE READY TO MAKE HER SACRIFICE BRAVELY WHEN THE TIME CAME AND EACH PRAYED THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE REQUIRED OF HER. DAY AFTER DAY HE HURRIED AWAY TO HELP MISTER POWER IN THE SANITARY WORK THAT SOON CLAIMED ALL HEARTS AND HANDS AND DAY AFTER DAY HE CAME HOME WITH WHAT CHRISTIE CALLED THE HEROIC LOOK MORE PLAINLY WRITTEN ON HIS FACE. ALL THAT FIRST SUMMER SO SHORT AND STRANGE ALL THAT FIRST WINTER SO LONG AND HARD TO THOSE WHO WENT AND THOSE WHO STAYED DAVID WORKED AND WAITED AND THE WOMEN WAXED STRONG IN THE NEW ATMOSPHERE OF SELF SACRIFICE WHICH PERVADED THE AIR BRINGING OUT THE STURDY VIRTUES OF THE NORTH. HOW TERRIBLE OH WHEN WILL IT BE OVER SIGHED LETTY ONE DAY AFTER HEARING A LONG LIST OF THE DEAD AND WOUNDED IN ONE OF THE GREAT BATTLES OF THAT SECOND SUMMER. NEVER TILL WE HAVE BEATEN CRIED DAVID THROWING DOWN THE PAPER AND WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM WITH HIS HEAD UP LIKE A WAR HORSE WHO SMELLS POWDER. IT IS TERRIBLE AND YET GLORIOUS. I THANK HEAVEN I LIVE TO SEE THIS GREAT WRONG RIGHTED AND ONLY WISH I COULD DO MY SHARE LIKE A MAN. AS THE ONLY SON OF A WIDOW YOU CAN'T BE DRAFTED THAT'S ONE COMFORT SAID LETTY WHO COULD NOT BEAR TO GIVE UP THE BROTHER LOST TO HER FOR SO MANY YEARS. I SHOULD NOT WAIT FOR THAT AND I KNOW MOTHER WOULD GIVE HER WIDOW'S MITE IF SHE SAW THAT IT WAS NEEDED YES DAVY. DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SAYING GRATEFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER THEN FIXING HIS EYES ON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DEARER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMPT AY AY IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR. NOW LISTEN YOU DEAR SOULS AND UNDERSTAND THAT IF I DO THIS THING I SHALL NOT DO IT HASTILY NOR WITHOUT COUNTING WELL THE COST. MY FIRST AND MOST NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO IN THE BEGINNING BUT I STAYED FOR YOUR SAKES
