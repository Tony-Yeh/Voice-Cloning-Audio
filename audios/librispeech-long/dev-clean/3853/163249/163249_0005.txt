HE HAD ENLISTED IN DAVID'S REGIMENT WHICH WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HIS WIFE FOR THOUGH HER STOUT HEART NEVER FAILED HER IT GREW VERY HEAVY AT TIMES AND WHEN LISHA WAS GONE SHE OFTEN DROPPED A PRIVATE TEAR OVER THE BROKEN PIPE THAT ALWAYS LAY IN ITS OLD PLACE AND VENTED HER EMOTIONS BY SENDING BASKETS OF NOURISHMENT TO PRIVATE WILKINS WHICH CAUSED THAT BANDY LEGGED WARRIOR TO BE MUCH ENVIED AND CHERISHED BY HIS MATES. I'M GLAD I DONE IT FOR IT WILL MAKE A MAN OF LISHA AND IF I'VE SENT HIM TO HIS DEATH GOD KNOWS HE'LL BE FITTER TO DIE THAN IF HE STAYED HERE IDLIN HIS LIFE AWAY. THEN THE GOOD SOUL OPENLY SHOULDERED THE BURDEN SHE HAD BORNE SO LONG IN SECRET AND BRAVELY TRUDGED ON ALONE. ANOTHER GREAT BATTLE SCREAMED THE EXCITED NEWS BOYS IN THE STREETS. ANOTHER GREAT BATTLE READ LETTY IN THE COTTAGE PARLOR. THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTANT WAS PRECIOUS. WHEN THE FIRST GREETINGS WERE OVER DAVID STOOD SILENT AN INSTANT AND A SUDDEN MIST CAME OVER HIS EYES AS HE GLANCED FROM ONE BELOVED FACE TO ANOTHER THEN HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD WITH THE OLD IMPATIENT GESTURE SQUARED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID IN A LOUD CHEERFUL VOICE WITH A SUSPICIOUS UNDERTONE OF EMOTION IN IT HOWEVER. MY PRECIOUS PEOPLE I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU ARE YOU READY. THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD MISSUS STERLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD. LETTY TURNED PALE AND DROPPED HER WORK BUT CHRISTIE'S EYES KINDLED AS SHE ANSWERED WITH A SALUTE READY MY GENERAL. WE ARE ORDERED OFF AT ONCE AND GO AT FOUR THIS AFTERNOON I'VE GOT A THREE HOURS LEAVE TO SAY GOOD BY IN. NOW LET'S BE BRAVE AND ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT. WE WILL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU DAVY ASKED CHRISTIE WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOO. KEEP YOUR PROMISE DEAR HE ANSWERED WHILE THE WARLIKE EXPRESSION CHANGED TO ONE OF INFINITE TENDERNESS WHAT PROMISE. THIS AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND WITH A LITTLE PAPER IN IT. SHE SAW IT WAS A MARRIAGE LICENSE AND ON IT LAY A WEDDING RING. SHE DID NOT HESITATE AN INSTANT BUT LAID HER OWN HAND IN HIS AND ANSWERED WITH HER HEART IN HER FACE. I'LL KEEP IT DAVID I KNEW YOU WOULD. AS A MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED THERE FOR HE COULD NOT ADD AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU. SHE UNDERSTOOD PUT BOTH ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK AS IF TO KEEP HIM SAFE AND WHISPERED FERVENTLY. NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOR EVER. THEN YOU ARE QUITE WILLING TO TRY THE THIRD GREAT EXPERIMENT. GLAD AND PROUD TO DO IT. WITH NO DOUBT NO FEAR TO MAR YOUR CONSENT. NOT ONE DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVE CHRISTIE. THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THE SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TONGUE CAN UTTER. PRESENTLY DAVID SAID REGRETFULLY. I MEANT IT SHOULD BE SO DIFFERENT I ALWAYS PLANNED THAT WE'D BE MARRIED SOME BRIGHT SUMMER DAY WITH MANY FRIENDS ABOUT US THEN TAKE A HAPPY LITTLE JOURNEY SOMEWHERE TOGETHER AND COME BACK TO SETTLE DOWN AT HOME IN THE DEAR OLD WAY. NOW IT'S ALL SO HURRIED SORROWFUL AND STRANGE. A DULL NOVEMBER DAY NO FRIENDS BUT MISTER POWER WHO WILL BE HERE SOON NO JOURNEY BUT MY MARCH TO WASHINGTON ALONE AND NO HAPPY COMING HOME TOGETHER IN THIS WORLD PERHAPS. HAVE NO FEAR FOR ME I FEEL AS IF I COULD BEAR ANY THING JUST NOW FOR I'VE GOT INTO A HEROIC MOOD AND I MEAN TO KEEP SO AS LONG AS I CAN. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO LIVE IN STIRRING TIMES TO HAVE A PART IN GREAT DEEDS TO SACRIFICE AND SUFFER SOMETHING FOR A PRINCIPLE OR A PERSON AND NOW I HAVE MY WISH. I LIKE IT DAVID IT'S A GRAND TIME TO LIVE A SPLENDID CHANCE TO DO AND SUFFER AND I WANT TO BE IN IT HEART AND SOUL AND EARN A LITTLE OF THE GLORY OR THE MARTYRDOM THAT WILL COME IN THE END
