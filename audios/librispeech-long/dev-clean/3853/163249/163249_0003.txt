BUT THE LITTLE QUAKER CAP WENT DOWN ON THE BROAD SHOULDER AND THE ONLY ANSWER HE HEARD WAS A SOB THAT STIRRED THE SOFT FOLDS OVER THE TENDER OLD HEART THAT CLUNG SO CLOSELY TO THE SON WHO HAD LIVED FOR HER SO LONG. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE TWILIGHT NO ONE EVER KNEW BUT DAVID RECEIVED PROMOTION FOR BRAVERY IN A HARDER BATTLE THAN ANY HE WAS GOING TO AND FROM HIS MOTHER'S BREAST A DECORATION MORE PRECIOUS TO HIM THAN THE CROSS OF THE LEGION OF HONOR FROM A ROYAL HAND. WHEN MISTER POWER PRESENTLY CAME IN FOLLOWED BY THE OTHERS THEY FOUND THEIR SOLDIER STANDING VERY ERECT IN HIS OLD PLACE ON THE RUG WITH THE FIRELIGHT GLEAMING ON HIS BRIGHT BUTTONS AND BRAN STARING AT HIM WITH A PERPLEXED ASPECT FOR THE UNIFORM SHORN HAIR TRIMMED BEARD AND A CERTAIN LOFTY CARRIAGE OF THE HEAD SO CHANGED HIS MASTER THAT THE SAGACIOUS BEAST WAS DISTURBED. LETTY SMILED AT HIM APPROVINGLY THEN WENT TO COMFORT HER MOTHER WHO COULD NOT RECOVER HER TRANQUILLITY SO SOON. BUT CHRISTIE STOOD ALOOF LOOKING AT HER LOVER WITH SOMETHING MORE THAN ADMIRATION IN THE FACE THAT KINDLED BEAUTIFULLY AS SHE EXCLAIMED. O DAVID YOU ARE SPLENDID. ONCE I WAS SO BLIND I THOUGHT YOU PLAIN BUT NOW MY BOY IN BLUE IS THE NOBLEST LOOKING MAN I EVER SAW. YES MISTER POWER I'VE FOUND MY HERO AT LAST. HERE HE IS MY KNIGHT WITHOUT REPROACH OR FEAR GOING OUT TO TAKE HIS PART IN THE GRANDEST BATTLE EVER FOUGHT. THEN HAVING POURED OUT THE LOVE AND PRIDE AND CONFIDENCE THAT ENRICHED HER SACRIFICE SHE BROKE DOWN AND CLUNG TO HIM WEEPING AS SO MANY CLUNG AND WEPT IN THOSE HARD DAYS WHEN MEN AND WOMEN GAVE THEIR DEAREST AND THOSE WHO PRAYED AND WAITED SUFFERED ALMOST AS MUCH AS THOSE WHO FOUGHT AND DIED. WHEN THE DEED WAS ONCE DONE IT WAS ASTONISHING WHAT SATISFACTION THEY ALL TOOK IN IT HOW SOON THEY GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THE CHANGE AND WHAT PRIDE THEY FELT IN OUR SOLDIER. THE LOYAL FRENZY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY. MISSUS STERLING CUT UP HER TREASURED OLD LINEN WITHOUT A MURMUR LETTY MADE COMFORT BAGS BY THE DOZEN PUT UP JELLY AND SEWED ON BLUE JACKETS WITH TIRELESS INDUSTRY WHILE CHRISTIE PROCLAIMED THAT IF SHE HAD TWENTY LOVERS SHE WOULD SEND THEM ALL AND THEN MADE PREPARATIONS ENOUGH TO NURSE THE ENTIRE PARTY. IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY KNAPSACKS TO HOLD ALL THE GIFTS SHOWERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. HE ACCEPTED ALL THAT CAME AND FURNISHED FORTH THOSE OF HIS COMPANY WHO WERE LESS FAVORED. AMONG THESE WAS ELISHA WILKINS AND HOW HE GOT THERE SHOULD BE TOLD. ELISHA HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF ENLISTING BUT MISSUS WILKINS WAS A LOYAL SOUL AND COULD NOT REST TILL SHE HAD SENT A SUBSTITUTE SINCE SHE COULD NOT GO HERSELF. FINDING THAT LISHA SHOWED LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VARIOUS SORTS. SHE READ STIRRING ACCOUNTS OF BATTLES CAREFULLY OMITTING THE DEAD AND WOUNDED SHE TURNED OUT BABY AND ALL IF POSSIBLE TO CHEER EVERY REGIMENT THAT LEFT AND WAS NEVER TIRED OF TELLING WASH HOW SHE WISHED SHE COULD ADD TEN YEARS TO HIS AGE AND SEND HIM OFF TO FIGHT FOR HIS COUNTRY LIKE A MAN. VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WILKINS RESOLUTELY TO HERSELF EF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOUL I WILL ON HIS STOMMICK AND SEE HOW THAT'LL WORK. WHICH THREAT SHE CARRIED OUT WITH SUCH SKILL AND FORCE THAT LISHA WAS EFFECTUALLY WAKED UP FOR HE WAS PARTIAL TO GOOD VITTLES AND CYNTHY WAS A CAPITAL COOK. POOR RATIONS DID NOT SUIT HIM AND HE DEMANDED WHY HIS FAVORITE DISHES WERE NOT FORTHCOMING. WE CAN'T AFFORD NO NICE VITTLES NOW WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERIN SO. I SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO COOK EM AND EXPECT TO CHOKE TRYIN TO EAT EM. EVERY ONE IS SACRIFICIN SOMETHIN AND WE MUSTN'T BE SLACK IN DOIN OUR PART THE LORD KNOWS IT'S PRECIOUS LITTLE AND THERE WON'T BE NO STUFFIN IN THIS HOUSE FOR A CONSID'ABLE SPELL. EF I COULD SAVE UP ENOUGH TO SEND A MAN TO DO MY SHARE OF THE FIGHTIN I SHOULD BE PROUD TO DO IT
