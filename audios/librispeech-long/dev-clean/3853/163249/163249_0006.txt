SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO ACHE AS IT NEVER HAS ACHED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILS AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOUL COUNTS THE COST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER. HELP ME TO BE BRAVE AND STRONG DAVID DON'T LET ME COMPLAIN OR REGRET BUT SHOW ME WHAT LIES BEYOND AND TEACH ME TO BELIEVE THAT SIMPLY DOING THE RIGHT IS REWARD AND HAPPINESS ENOUGH. CHRISTIE WAS LIFTED OUT OF HERSELF FOR THE MOMENT AND LOOKED INSPIRED BY THE HIGH MOOD WHICH WAS BUT THE BEGINNING OF A NOBLER LIFE FOR HER. DAVID CAUGHT THE EXALTATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT TO ANY THING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOK INTO THE ILLUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED. I'LL TRY WAS ALL HIS ANSWER TO HER APPEAL THEN PROVED THAT HE MEANT IT BY ADDING WITH HIS LIPS AGAINST HER CHEEK I MUST GO TO MOTHER AND LETTY WE LEAVE THEM BEHIND AND THEY MUST BE COMFORTED. HE WENT AND CHRISTIE VANISHED TO MAKE READY FOR HER WEDDING CONSCIOUS IN SPITE OF HER EXALTED STATE OF MIND THAT EVERY THING WAS VERY HURRIED SAD AND STRANGE AND VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE HAPPY DAY SHE HAD SO OFTEN PLANNED. DAVID SENDS YOU THESE DEAR. CAN I HELP IN ANY WAY ASKED LETTY COMING WITH A CLUSTER OF LOVELY WHITE ROSES IN HER HAND AND A WORLD OF AFFECTION IN HER EYES. I THOUGHT HE'D GIVE ME VIOLETS AND A SHADOW CAME OVER CHRISTIE'S FACE. BUT THEY ARE MOURNING FLOWERS YOU KNOW NOT TO ME. THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABY'S LITTLE COFFIN. MY DEAREST CHRISTIE DON'T BE SUPERSTITIOUS ALL BRIDES WEAR ROSES AND DAVY THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE THEM SAID LETTY TROUBLED AT HER WORDS. THEN I'LL WEAR THEM AND I WON'T HAVE FANCIES IF I CAN HELP IT. BUT I THINK FEW BRIDES DRESS WITH A BRAVER HAPPIER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE A SOBER WEDDING GOWN ANSWERED CHRISTIE SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM A HALF PACKED TRUNK HER NEW HOSPITAL SUIT OF SOFT GRAY WOOLLEN STUFF. NO I WILL BE MARRIED IN MY UNIFORM AS DAVID IS SHE ANSWERED WITH A LOOK LETTY LONG REMEMBERED. MISTER POWER HAS COME SHE SAID SOFTLY A FEW MINUTES LATER WITH AN ANXIOUS GLANCE AT THE CLOCK. GO DEAR I'LL COME DIRECTLY. BUT FIRST AND CHRISTIE HELD HER FRIEND CLOSE A MOMENT KISSED HER TENDERLY AND WHISPERED IN A BROKEN VOICE REMEMBER I DON'T TAKE HIS HEART FROM YOU I ONLY SHARE IT WITH MY SISTER AND MY MOTHER. I'M GLAD TO GIVE HIM TO YOU CHRISTIE FOR NOW I FEEL AS IF I HAD PARTLY PAID THE GREAT DEBT I'VE OWED SO LONG ANSWERED LETTY THROUGH HER TEARS. NO BRIDAL WHITE DEAR SAID DAVID GOING TO HER. ONLY THIS AND SHE TOUCHED THE FLOWERS ADDING WITH HER HAND ON THE BLUE COAT SLEEVE THAT EMBRACED HER I WANT TO CONSECRATE MY UNIFORM AS YOU DO YOURS BY BEING MARRIED IN IT. ISN'T IT FITTER FOR A SOLDIER'S WIFE THAN LACE AND SILK AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS. MUCH FITTER I LIKE IT AND I FIND YOU BEAUTIFUL MY CHRISTIE WHISPERED DAVID AS SHE PUT ONE OF HER ROSES IN HIS BUTTON HOLE THEN I'M SATISFIED. MISTER POWER IS WAITING ARE YOU READY LOVE QUITE READY. THEN THEY WERE MARRIED WITH LETTY AND HER MOTHER STANDING BESIDE THEM BENNET AND HIS WIFE DIMLY VISIBLE IN THE DOOR WAY AND POOR BRAN AT HIS MASTER'S FEET LOOKING UP WITH WISTFUL EYES HALF HUMAN IN THE ANXIOUS AFFECTION THEY EXPRESSED. CHRISTIE NEVER FORGOT THAT SERVICE SO SIMPLE SWEET AND SOLEMN NOR THE LOOK HER HUSBAND GAVE HER AT THE END WHEN HE KISSED HER ON LIPS AND FOREHEAD SAYING FERVENTLY GOD BLESS MY WIFE. ONE HOUR MORE IS ALL YOU HAVE SO MAKE THE MOST OF IT DEARLY BELOVED. YOU YOUNG FOLKS TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WHILE WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU. THEN THEY WERE MARRIED
