ANYWAY I SHALL STINT THE FAMILY AND SEND THEM DEAR BRAVE FELLERS EVERY CENT I CAN GIT WITHOUT STARVIN THE CHILDREN. NOW CYNTHY DON'T BE FERCE. HE SAID NO MORE BUT FELL A THINKING. HE WAS NOT AS UNMOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUNDRY MANLY IMPULSES TO UP AND AT EM WHEN HIS COMRADES IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRISIS WITH IREFUL BRANDISHING OF AWLS AND VENGEFUL POUNDING OF SOLE LEATHER AS IF THE REBELS WERE UNDER THE HAMMER. NATURE ABHORS A VACUUM AND WHEN FOOD FELL SHORT PATRIOTISM HAD A CHANCE TO FILL THE ACHING VOID. AN UNEXPECTED ALLY APPEARED HOWEVER AND THE GOOD WOMAN TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT TO STRIKE ONE LAST BLOW. LISHA SAT EATING A LATE BREAKFAST ONE MORNING WITH A SMALL SON AT EITHER ELBOW WAITING FOR STRAY MOUTHFULS AND COMMITTING PETTY LARCENIES RIGHT AND LEFT FOR PA WAS IN A BROWN STUDY. MISSUS WILKINS WAS FRYING FLAP JACKS AND THOUGH THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED AN HEROICAL EMPLOYMENT SHE MADE IT SO THAT DAY. THIS WAS A FAVORITE DISH OF LISHA'S AND SHE HAD PREPARED IT AS A BAIT FOR THIS CAUTIOUS FISH. TO SAY THAT THE FISH ROSE AT ONCE AND SWALLOWED THE BAIT HOOK AND ALL BUT FEEBLY EXPRESSES THE JUSTICE DONE TO THE CAKES BY THAT LONG SUFFERING MAN. WAITING TILL HE HAD A TEMPTING PILE OF THE LIGHTEST BROWNEST FLAPJACKS EVER SEEN UPON HIS PLATE AND WAS WATCHING AN EXTRA BIG BIT OF BUTTER MELT LUXURIOUSLY INTO THE WARM BOSOM OF THE UPPER ONE WITH A FACE AS BENIGN AS IF SOME OF THE MOLASSES HE WAS TRICKLING OVER THEM HAD BEEN ABSORBED INTO HIS NATURE MISSUS WILKINS SEIZED THE PROPITIOUS MOMENT TO SAY IMPRESSIVELY. DAVID STERLIN HAS ENLISTED. WELL HE AIN'T GOT A FAMILY YOU SEE. EVERY ONE GIVES SOMETHIN I'VE ONLY GOT YOU AND I WANT TO DO MY SHARE AND DO IT HEARTY. IMAGINE HER DISMAY WHEN HAVING CONSUMED THE BAIT HER FISH GAVE SIGNS OF BREAKING THE LINE AND ESCAPING AFTER ALL FOR MISTER WILKINS PUSHED BACK HIS CHAIR AND SAID SLOWLY AS HE FILLED HIS PIPE. I'M BLEST EF I CAN SEE THE SENSE OF A LOT OF DECENT MEN GOING OFF TO BE FROZE AND STARVED AND BLOWED UP JEST FOR THEM CONFOUNDED NIGGERS. CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HEPSEY TOLD US AND CALL THEM POOR LONG SUFFERIN CREETERS NAMES. LISHA WILKINS LOOK AT THAT AND SAY NO EF YOU DARST. ONLY HEPSEY SITTING BY A BED WHERE LAY WHAT LOOKED MORE LIKE A SHRIVELLED MUMMY THAN A WOMAN. AH BUT IT WAS THAT OLD MOTHER WORKED AND WAITED FOR SO LONG BLIND NOW AND DEAF CHILDISH AND HALF DEAD WITH MANY HARDSHIPS BUT SAFE AND FREE AT LAST AND HEPSEY'S BLACK FACE WAS FULL OF A PRIDE A PEACE AND HAPPINESS MORE ELOQUENT AND TOUCHING THAN ANY SPEECH OR SERMON EVER UTTERED. HE'S A COMIN MA CALLED GUSTY PRESENTLY. NO HE AIN'T IT'S A TRAINER ADDED ANN LIZY. BEFORE MISSUS WILKINS COULD REPLY TO THESE CONFLICTING RUMORS HER HUSBAND WALKED IN LOOKING AS MARTIAL AS HIS HOLLOW CHEST AND THIN LEGS PERMITTED AND TURNING HIS CAP NERVOUSLY IN HIS HANDS SAID HALF PROUDLY HALF REPROACHFULLY. NOW CYNTHY BE YOU SATISFIED. OH MY LISHA I BE I BE. AND THE INCONSISTENT WOMAN FELL UPON HIS BUTTONY BREAST WEEPING COPIOUSLY. IF EVER A MAN WAS PRAISED AND PETTED ADMIRED AND CARESSED IT WAS ELISHA WILKINS THAT DAY. HIS WIFE FED HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOLVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED IN TO APPLAUD ADVISE AND ADMIRE EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH A RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCREASED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND BORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
