CHRISTIE'S RETURN WAS A VERY HAPPY ONE AND COULD NOT WELL BE OTHERWISE WITH A MOTHER SISTER AND LOVER TO WELCOME HER BACK. HER MEETING WITH LETTY WAS INDESCRIBABLY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NURSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER. THERE WAS NO CLOUD NOW IN CHRISTIE'S SKY AND ALL THE WORLD SEEMED IN BLOOM. BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGRUDGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAM WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID. SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN SUCH PERFECT HAPPINESS IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THIS WORLD. THEN LET US MAKE THE MOST OF IT DAVID WOULD REPLY WISELY BENT ON GETTING HIS HONEY WHILE HE COULD AND NOT BORROWING TROUBLE FOR THE MORROW. SO CHRISTIE TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HER PROPHETIC SOUL AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE BLISSFUL HOLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST. EVEN WHILE MARCH WINDS WERE HOWLING OUTSIDE SHE BLISSFULLY POKED IN THE DIRT WITH DAVID IN THE GREEN HOUSE PUT UP THE CURLY LOCK AS OFTEN AS SHE LIKED AND TOLD HIM SHE LOVED HIM A DOZEN TIMES A DAY NOT IN WORDS BUT IN SILENT WAYS THAT TOUCHED HIM TO THE HEART AND MADE HIS FUTURE LOOK SO BRIGHT HE HARDLY DARED BELIEVE IN IT. CHRISTIE OFTEN STOPPED TO WATCH AND WONDER IF THE BLITHE YOUNG MAN WHO WENT WHISTLING AND SINGING ABOUT THE HOUSE OFTEN STOPPING TO KISS SOMEBODY TO JOKE OR TO EXCLAIM WITH A BEAMING FACE LIKE A CHILD AT A PARTY ISN'T EVERY THING BEAUTIFUL. COULD BE THE SOBER STEADY DAVID WHO USED TO PLOD TO AND FRO WITH HIS SHOULDERS A LITTLE BENT AND THE ABSENT LOOK IN HIS EYES THAT TOLD OF THOUGHTS ABOVE OR BEYOND THE DAILY TASK. DAVY YOU ARE A HUMBUG SHE SAID ONE DAY WHEN THEY WERE MAKING UP A BRIDAL ORDER IN THE GREENHOUSE. I TOLD YOU SO BUT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT HE ANSWERED USING LONG STEMMED ROSE BUDS WITH AS PRODIGAL A HAND AS IF THE WEDDING WAS TO BE HIS OWN. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO MARRY A QUIET STUDIOUS STEADY GOING MAN AND HERE I FIND MYSELF ENGAGED TO A ROMANTIC YOUTH WHO FLIES ABOUT IN THE MOST UNDIGNIFIED MANNER EMBRACES PEOPLE BEHIND DOORS SINGS OPERA AIRS VERY MUCH OUT OF TUNE BY THE WAY AND CONDUCTS HIMSELF MORE LIKE AN INFATUATED CLAUDE MELNOTTE THAN A RESPECTABLE GENTLEMAN ON THE AWFUL VERGE OF MATRIMONY. NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW I'M PREPARED FOR ANY THING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUAKERISH LOVER DANCING A JIG. COME AND TAKE A TURN IT WILL DO YOU GOOD AND TO CHRISTIE'S UTTER AMAZEMENT DAVID CAUGHT HER ROUND THE WAIST AND WALTZED HER DOWN THE BOARDED WALK WITH A SPEED AND SKILL THAT CAUSED LESS HAVOC AMONG THE FLOWER POTS THAN ONE WOULD IMAGINE AND SEEMED TO DELIGHT THE PLANTS WHO RUSTLED AND NODDED AS IF APPLAUDING THE DANCE OF THE FINEST DOUBLE FLOWER THAT HAD EVER BLOSSOMED IN THEIR MIDST. I CAN'T HELP IT CHRISTIE HE SAID WHEN HE HAD LANDED HER BREATHLESS AND LAUGHING AT THE OTHER END. I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY. I'M NOT A TALKER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SOARING ALOFT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UPLIFTED STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT. NEVER MIND DIGNITY LET'S BE HAPPY AND BY AND BY I'LL SOBER DOWN. I DON'T WANT YOU TO I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HAPPY ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD DAVID AND I'VE GOT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW ONE. I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE FROST BITTEN OLD DAVID YOU FIRST KNEW AND WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LOVE. MOTHER SAYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE LOST LETTY AND I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I HAD. IN THAT CASE YOU WILL FIND ME A PROUD IMPETUOUS AMBITIOUS FELLOW CHRISTIE AND HOW WILL THAT SUIT. EXCELLENTLY I LIKE PRIDE OF YOUR SORT IMPETUOSITY BECOMES YOU FOR YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED BE AND THE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL. I ALWAYS WONDERED AT YOUR WANT OF IT AND LONGED TO STIR YOU UP FOR YOU DID NOT SEEM THE SORT OF MAN TO BE CONTENTED WITH MERE CREATURE COMFORTS WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY FINE THINGS MEN MAY DO. WHAT SHALL YOU CHOOSE DAVY. I SHALL WAIT FOR TIME TO SHOW. THE SAP IS ALL ASTIR IN ME AND I'M READY FOR MY CHANCE
