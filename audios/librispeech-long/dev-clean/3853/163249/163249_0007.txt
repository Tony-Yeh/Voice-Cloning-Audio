DAVID AND CHRISTIE WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHED ANY TEARS OVER THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOYALLY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS. MISTER POWER CHEERED THE OLD LADY WHILE LETTY ALWAYS GLAD TO SERVE MADE READY THE LAST MEAL DAVID MIGHT EVER TAKE AT HOME. A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIAGE FEAST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER WISHES ADORNED THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEDDING BREAKFASTS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH OR SONG WAS LETTY'S BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND DAVID'S EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US. HOW TIME WENT THAT DAY THE INEXORABLE CLOCK WOULD STRIKE TWELVE SO SOON AND THEN THE MINUTES FLEW TILL ONE WAS AT HAND AND THE LAST WORDS WERE STILL HALF SAID THE LAST GOOD BYES STILL UNUTTERED. I MUST GO CRIED DAVID WITH A SORT OF DESPERATION AS LETTY CLUNG TO ONE ARM CHRISTIE TO THE OTHER. GIVE THE LAST KISS TO MOTHER ADDED LETTY FOLLOWING HER EXAMPLE AND IN ANOTHER MINUTE DAVID WAS GONE. AT THE TURN OF THE LANE HE LOOKED BACK AND SWUNG HIS CAP ALL WAVED THEIR HANDS TO HIM AND THEN HE MARCHED AWAY TO THE GREAT WORK BEFORE HIM LEAVING THOSE LOVING HEARTS TO ASK THE UNANSWERABLE QUESTION HOW WILL HE COME HOME. CHRISTIE WAS GOING TO TOWN TO SEE THE REGIMENT OFF AND SOON FOLLOWED WITH MISTER POWER. THEY WENT EARLY TO A CERTAIN FAVORABLE SPOT AND THERE FOUND MISSUS WILKINS WITH HER ENTIRE FAMILY PERCHED UPON A FENCE ON THE SPIKES OF WHICH THEY IMPALED THEMSELVES AT INTERVALS AND HAD TO BE PLUCKED OFF BY THE STOUT GIRL ENGAGED TO ASSIST IN THIS MEMORABLE EXPEDITION. I HEAR DRUMS THEY'RE COMIN CRIED WASH AFTER A LONG HALF HOUR'S WAITING HAD NEARLY DRIVEN HIM FRANTIC. THE TWO YOUNGER BOYS IMMEDIATELY TUMBLED OFF THE FENCE AND WERE WITH DIFFICULTY RESTORED TO THEIR PERCHES. HOLD ON TO ME BEHIND SOMEBODY FOR I MUST SEE EF I DO PITCH INTO THE GUTTER CRIED MISSUS WILKINS WITH A GASP AS SHE WIPED HER EYES ON HER SHAWL CLUTCHED THE RAILING AND STOOD READY TO CHEER BRAVELY WHEN HER CONQUERING HERO CAME. WASH HAD HEARD DRUMS EVERY FIVE MINUTES SINCE HE ARRIVED BUT THIS TIME HE WAS RIGHT AND BEGAN TO CHEER THE INSTANT A RED COCKADE APPEARED AT THE OTHER END OF THE LONG STREET. IT WAS A DIFFERENT SCENE NOW THAN IN THE FIRST ENTHUSIASTIC HOPEFUL DAYS. YOUNG MEN AND ARDENT BOYS FILLED THE RANKS THEN BRAVE BY INSTINCT BURNING WITH LOYAL ZEAL AND BLISSFULLY IGNORANT OF ALL THAT LAY BEFORE THEM. LITTLE OF THE GLAMOUR OF ROMANCE ABOUT THE WAR NOW THEY SAW WHAT IT WAS A LONG HARD TASK AND HERE WERE THE MEN TO DO IT WELL EVEN THE LOOKERS ON WERE DIFFERENT. ONCE ALL WAS WILD ENTHUSIASM AND GLAD UPROAR NOW MEN'S LIPS WERE SET AND WOMEN'S SMILELESS EVEN AS THEY CHEERED FEWER HANDKERCHIEFS WHITENED THE AIR FOR WET EYES NEEDED THEM AND SUDDEN LULLS ALMOST SOLEMN IN THEIR STILLNESS FOLLOWED THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THE CROWD. ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND PROUD SOULS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW AND BRIGHT WITH A STEELY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET AND AWAY TO JOIN THE SEA OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND EBBED BACK REDDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE. AS THE INSPIRING MUSIC THE GRAND TRAMP DREW NEAR CHRISTIE FELT THE OLD THRILL AND LONGED TO FALL IN AND FOLLOW THE FLAG ANYWHERE. THEN SHE SAW DAVID AND THE REGIMENT BECAME ONE MAN TO HER. HE WAS PALE BUT HIS EYES SHONE AND HIS WHOLE FACE EXPRESSED THAT TWO OF THE BEST AND BRAVEST EMOTIONS OF A MAN LOVE AND LOYALTY WERE AT THEIR HEIGHT AS HE GAVE HIS NEW MADE WIFE A LONG LINGERING LOOK THAT SEEMED TO SAY. I COULD NOT LOVE THEE DEAR SO MUCH LOVED I NOT HONOR MORE
