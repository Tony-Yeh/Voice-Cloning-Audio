YOU SEE HOW MISTAKEN WE WERE AND GOD ONLY KNOWS WHEN THE END WILL COME. THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NOBLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL. YOU OWN THIS I SEE IT IN YOUR FACES THEN DON'T HOLD ME BACK WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR ME TO GO. I MUST DO MY PART HOWEVER SMALL IT IS OR I SHALL NEVER FEEL AS IF I DESERVED THE LOVE YOU GIVE ME. YOU WILL LET ME GO I AM SURE AND NOT REGRET THAT I DID WHAT SEEMED TO ME A SOLEMN DUTY LEAVING THE CONSEQUENCES TO THE LORD. YES DAVID SISTER AND SWEETHEART ANSWERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FERVOR OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD. I KNEW MY SPARTANS WOULD BE READY AND I WON'T DISGRACE THEM. BENNET WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND GREEN HOUSE OFF MY HANDS THIS AUTUMN FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE. HE'S A KIND NEIGHBORLY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE ABOUT THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOU FAITHFULLY. ONLY ONE DAUGHTER NEAR HER DAVID I SHALL ENLIST WHEN YOU DO SAID CHRISTIE RESOLUTELY YOU MEAN IT. I MEAN IT AS HONESTLY AS YOU DO. I KNEW YOU WOULD GO I SAW YOU GETTING READY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO FOLLOW. I TOO HAVE PREPARED FOR IT AND EVEN SPOKEN TO MISSUS AMORY. SHE HAS GONE AS MATRON OF A HOSPITAL AND PROMISED TO FIND A PLACE FOR ME WHEN I WAS READY. DEAR OUGHT I TO LET YOU DO IT. YOU WILL LET ME DO IT AND IN RETURN I WILL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK ME ANSWERED CHRISTIE SEALING THE PROMISE WITH A KISS THAT SILENCED HIM. HE HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO BE MARRIED LONG AGO BUT WHEN HE ASKED MISTER POWER TO MAKE HIM HAPPY A MONTH AFTER HIS ENGAGEMENT THAT WISE FRIEND SAID TO THEM I DON'T ADVISE IT YET. YOU HAVE TRIED AND PROVED ONE ANOTHER AS FRIENDS NOW TRY AND PROVE ONE ANOTHER AS LOVERS THEN IF YOU FEEL THAT ALL IS SAFE AND HAPPY YOU WILL BE READY FOR THE GREATEST OF THE THREE EXPERIMENTS AND THEN IN GOD'S NAME MARRY. WE WILL THEY SAID AND FOR A YEAR HAD BEEN CONTENT STUDYING ONE ANOTHER FINDING MUCH TO LOVE AND SOMETHING TO LEARN IN THE ART OF BEARING AND FORBEARING. SHE NEVER HAD YET AND NOW RESOLVED TO ASK NOTHING BUT TO EARN HER BLESSING BY DOING HER SHARE IN THE GREAT WORK. I SHALL REMEMBER THAT WAS ALL DAVID ANSWERED TO THAT LAST PROMISE OF HERS AND THREE MONTHS LATER HE TOOK HER AT HER WORD. FOR A WEEK OR TWO THEY WENT ON IN THE OLD WAY CHRISTIE DID HER HOUSEWORK WITH HER HEAD FULL OF NEW PLANS READ BOOKS ON NURSING MADE GRUEL PLASTERS AND POULTICES TILL MISSUS STERLING PRONOUNCED HER PERFECT AND DREAMED DREAMS OF A HAPPY TIME TO COME WHEN PEACE HAD RETURNED AND DAVID WAS SAFE AT HOME WITH ALL THE STARS AND BARS A MAN COULD WIN WITHOUT DYING FOR THEM. ONE SEPTEMBER DAY HE WENT SLOWLY HOME AND SEEING CHRISTIE IN THE GARDEN JOINED HER HELPED HER FINISH MATTING UP SOME DELICATE SHRUBS PUT BY THE TOOLS AND WHEN ALL WAS DONE SAID WITH UNUSUAL GENTLENESS. COME AND WALK A LITTLE IN THE LANE. SHE PUT HER ARM IN HIS AND ANSWERED QUICKLY. YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YOUR FACE DEAR I MUST GO. YES DAVID AND YOU. I GO TOO YES CHRISTIE. THAT WAS ALL SHE DID NOT OFFER TO DETAIN HIM NOW HE DID NOT DENY HER RIGHT TO FOLLOW. THEY LOOKED EACH OTHER BRAVELY IN THE FACE A MOMENT SEEING ACKNOWLEDGING THE DUTY AND THE DANGER YET READY TO DO THE ONE AND DARE THE OTHER SINCE THEY WENT TOGETHER. THEN SHOULDER TO SHOULDER AS IF ALREADY MUSTERED IN THESE FAITHFUL COMRADES MARCHED TO AND FRO PLANNING THEIR CAMPAIGN. NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STERLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT A TALL MAN IN ARMY BLUE ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUIL FIGURE FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UNSOLDIERLY CHOKE IN THE VOICE. I'VE DONE IT MOTHER TELL ME YOU'RE NOT SORRY
