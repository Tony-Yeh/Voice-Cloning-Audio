SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYING ASLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STREWED AMONG THEM. HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUT SHELL YOU CAN SPLIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE NUT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CHESTNUT IN ITS BUR. HOW DID IT HAPPEN AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN. FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES. FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL. WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY. THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS THIS HOUSE AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE. SO HE LET THEM GROW AND RIPEN AND FALL TO THE GROUND AND THEN THE GREAT ROCKS WERE PILED ABOVE THEM TO CROWD THEM COMPACTLY TOGETHER AND THEY WERE HEATED AND HEAVILY PRESSED UNTIL AS THE AGES WENT BY THEY CHANGED SLOWLY INTO THESE HARD BLACK SHINING STONES AND BECAME BETTER FUEL THAN ANY WOOD BECAUSE THE SUBSTANCE OF WOOD WAS CONCENTRATED IN THEM. THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND. AND SO AT LAST FOLLOWING THEIR QUESTIONS TO FIND THEIR WAY TO THE SECRET STORES AND MAKE AN OPEN DOORWAY AND LET THE WORLD IN. AT FIRST THEY ONLY UNDERSTOOD THIS SIMPLEST AND PLAINEST VALUE OF THE COAL. BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE THE GAS FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARM ONLY. THE THOUGHT CAME TO THEM THAT IT MIGHT BE PREPARED FROM COAL AND CONDUCTED THROUGH PIPES TO OUR HOUSES TO TAKE THE PLACE OF LAMPS OR CANDLES WHICH UNTIL THAT TIME HAD BEEN THE ONLY LIGHT. IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT. AND SO IT BEGAN TO BE USED TO COVER ROOFS OF BUILDINGS AND MIXED WITH SOME OTHER SUBSTANCES MADE A PAVEMENT FOR STREETS AND BEING SPREAD OVER IRON WORK IT PROTECTED IT FROM RUST. DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REFUSE COAL TAR. BESIDES THE DYES WE SHALL ALSO HAVE LEFT NAPHTHA USEFUL IN MAKING VARNISH AND VARIOUS OILS THAT ARE USED IN MORE WAYS THAN I CAN STOP TO TELL YOU OR YOU WOULD CARE NOW TO HEAR. UP CAME THE OIL SPOUTING AND RUNNING OVER GUSHING OUT AND STREAMING DOWN TO A LITTLE RIVER THAT RAN NEAR BY
