ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERY THING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES. SO HE BUILT THE BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND ANY ONE JUST TO LOOK AT THE OUTSIDE OF IT WOULD EXCLAIM HOW LOVELY. THE FLOORS WERE CARPETED WITH VELVET AND THE WHOLE WAS LIGHTED WITH LAMPS THAT SHONE LIKE STARS FROM ABOVE. THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WITH THEIR SONGS. AT FIRST YOU KNOW THEY WILL ONLY PLAY. WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING. AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STOREHOUSE. BUT DO YOU IMAGINE THAT SENSIBLE CHILDREN AFTER ONE SUCH DISCOVERY WOULD REST SATISFIED. OF COURSE THEY WOULD EXPLORE AND EXPLORE TRY EVERY PANEL AND PRESS EVERY SPRING UNTIL ONE BY ONE ALL THE CLOSETS SHOULD BE OPENED AND ALL THE TREASURES BROUGHT OUT. AND THEN HOW COULD THEY SHOW THEIR GRATITUDE TO THE DEAR FATHER WHO HAD TAKEN SUCH PAINS TO PREPARE THIS WONDERFUL HOUSE FOR THEM. THE LEAST THEY COULD DO WOULD BE TO TRY TO USE EVERY THING FOR THE PURPOSES INTENDED AND NOT TO DESTROY OR INJURE ANY OF THE PRECIOUS GIFTS PREPARED SO LOVINGLY FOR THEIR USE. IF YOU HAVE NOT PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH ME TO EXAMINE ONE THAT WAS OPENED A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO BUT CONTAINS SUCH VALUABLE THINGS THAT THE USES OF ALL OF THEM HAVE NOT YET BEEN FOUND OUT AND THEIR BEAUTY IS JUST BEGINNING TO BE KNOWN. THE DOORWAY OF THIS STOREHOUSE LIES IN THE SIDE OF A HILL. THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US. WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOT PATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES. BUT YOU WILL FIND THAT THEY ARE REALLY PULLED AND PUSHED BY AN ENGINE THAT STANDS OUTSIDE THE DOORWAY AND REACHES THEM BY LONG CHAINS. AT LAST WE REACH THE FOOT OF THE SLOPE AND AS OUR EYES BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE FAINT LIGHT WE CAN SEE PASSAGES LEADING TO THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT AND SQUARE CHAMBERS CUT OUT IN THE SOLID HILL. SO THIS GREAT GREEN HILL UPON WHICH YOU MIGHT RUN OR PLAY IS INSIDE LIKE WHAT I THINK SOME OF THOSE LARGE ANTHILLS MUST BE TRAVERSED BY GALLERIES AND FULL OF ROOMS AND LONG PASSAGES. ALL ABOUT WE SEE MEN LIKE OUR GUIDE WORKING BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR LITTLE LAMPS. WE HEAR THE ECHOING SOUND OF THE TOOLS AND WE SEE GREAT BLOCKS AND HEAPS THAT THEY HAVE BROKEN AWAY AND LOADED INTO LITTLE CARS THAT STAND READY HERE AND THERE TO BE DRAWN BY MULES TO THE FOOT OF THE SLOPE. NOW ARE YOU CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THIS TREASURE IS. LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE
