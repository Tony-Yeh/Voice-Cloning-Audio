CHAPTER TWELVE STRANGELY LIBERATED. THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHITI RANGES WERE LIT WITH THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY. THEY HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH. OVERCOME AS THEY WERE WITH HORROR AND FATIGUE THEY TOOK THEIR LAST MEAL TOGETHER. WE MUST SHOW THESE SAVAGES HOW EUROPEANS CAN DIE. THE MEAL ENDED. LADY HELENA REPEATED THE EVENING PRAYER ALOUD HER COMPANIONS BARE HEADED REPEATED IT AFTER HER. WHO DOES NOT TURN HIS THOUGHTS TOWARD GOD IN THE HOUR OF DEATH. THIS DONE THE PRISONERS EMBRACED EACH OTHER. MARY GRANT AND HELENA IN A CORNER OF THE HUT LAY DOWN ON A MAT. SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ABEYANCE SOON WEIGHED DOWN THEIR EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING. THEN GLENARVAN TAKING HIS FRIENDS ASIDE SAID MY DEAR FRIENDS OUR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF THESE POOR WOMEN ARE IN GOD'S HANDS. IF IT IS DECREED THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE. GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEW. BUT DEATH HERE MEANS NOT DEATH ONLY IT MEANS TORTURE INSULT PERHAPS AND HERE ARE TWO LADIES. GLENARVAN'S VOICE FIRM TILL NOW FALTERED. JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHAT I PROMISED LADY HELENA WHAT IS YOUR PLAN. I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE. YES JOHN BUT WE ARE UNARMED. NO REPLIED JOHN SHOWING HIM A DAGGER. MY LORD WHICHEVER OF US SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFILL THE WISH OF LADY HELENA AND MARY GRANT. AFTER THESE WORDS WERE SAID A PROFOUND SILENCE ENSUED. AT LAST THE MAJOR SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT. I AM NOT AN ADVOCATE OF IRREMEDIABLE MEASURES. I DID NOT SPEAK FOR OURSELVES SAID GLENARVAN. BE IT AS IT MAY WE CAN FACE DEATH. HAD WE BEEN ALONE I SHOULD ERE NOW HAVE CRIED MY FRIENDS LET US MAKE AN EFFORT LET US ATTACK THESE WRETCHES. BUT WITH THESE POOR GIRLS. AT THIS MOMENT JOHN RAISED THE MAT AND COUNTED TWENTY FIVE NATIVES KEEPING GUARD ON THE WARE ATOUA. BUT THEY ALL KEPT WATCHFUL GUARD ON THE HUT CONFIDED TO THEIR CARE. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT BETWEEN A VIGILANT JAILER AND A PRISONER WHO WISHES TO ESCAPE THE CHANCES ARE IN FAVOR OF THE PRISONER THE FACT IS THE INTEREST OF THE ONE IS KEENER THAN THAT OF THE OTHER. THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED. THE CAPTIVE THINKS OFTENER OF ESCAPING THAN THE JAILER OF PREVENTING HIS FLIGHT AND HENCE WE HEAR OF FREQUENT AND WONDERFUL ESCAPES. ON ITS TWO OTHER SIDES ROSE POINTED ROCKS WHICH JUTTED OUT OVER AN ABYSS A HUNDRED FEET DEEP. ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
