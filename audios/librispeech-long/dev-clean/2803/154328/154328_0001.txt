THE ONLY OUTLET WAS THE REGULAR DOOR OF THE WARE ATOUA AND THE MAORIES GUARDED THE PROMONTORY WHICH UNITED IT TO THE PAH LIKE A DRAWBRIDGE. ALL ESCAPE WAS THUS HOPELESS AND GLENARVAN HAVING TRIED THE WALLS FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME WAS COMPELLED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS SO. THE HOURS OF THIS NIGHT WRETCHED AS THEY WERE SLIPPED AWAY. THICK DARKNESS HAD SETTLED ON THE MOUNTAIN. NEITHER MOON NOR STARS PIERCED THE GLOOM. THE GROUP OF PRISONERS WAS LIT UP FOR A MOMENT THEY WERE ABSORBED IN THEIR LAST THOUGHTS AND A DEATHLIKE SILENCE REIGNED IN THE HUT. MC NABBS WAS AT FIRST INDIFFERENT BUT FINDING THE NOISE CONTINUE HE LISTENED THEN HIS CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED AND HE PUT HIS EAR TO THE GROUND IT SOUNDED AS IF SOMEONE WAS SCRAPING OR HOLLOWING OUT THE GROUND OUTSIDE. LISTEN SAID HE MOTIONING THEM TO STOOP. THE SCRATCHING BECAME MORE AND MORE AUDIBLE THEY COULD HEAR THE LITTLE STONES GRATE ON A HARD BODY AND ROLL AWAY. SOME ANIMAL IN HIS BURROW SAID JOHN MANGLES. GLENARVAN STRUCK HIS FOREHEAD. WHO KNOWS SAID HE IT MIGHT BE A MAN. ANIMAL OR MAN ANSWERED THE MAJOR I WILL SOON FIND OUT. WILSON AND OLBINETT JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH THEIR NAILS WHILE MULRADY STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD THROUGH A CREVICE OF THE MATTING. THE SOIL WAS LIGHT AND FRIABLE AND BELOW LAY A BED OF SILICIOUS TUFA THEREFORE EVEN WITHOUT TOOLS THE APERTURE DEEPENED QUICKLY. IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT A MAN OR MEN CLINGING TO THE SIDES OF THE PAH WERE CUTTING A PASSAGE INTO ITS EXTERIOR WALL. WHAT COULD BE THE OBJECT. DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS IT SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING. THE PRISONERS REDOUBLED THEIR EFFORTS. THEIR FINGERS BLED BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASED SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION. SOME MINUTES MORE PASSED AND THE MAJOR WITHDREW HIS HAND FROM THE STROKE OF A SHARP BLADE HE SUPPRESSED A CRY. JOHN MANGLES INSERTING THE BLADE OF HIS PONIARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELDED IT. IT WAS THE HAND OF A WOMAN OR CHILD A EUROPEAN. ON NEITHER SIDE HAD A WORD BEEN UTTERED IT WAS EVIDENTLY THE CUE OF BOTH SIDES TO BE SILENT. BUT SOFTLY AS THE NAME WAS BREATHED MARY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARD GLENARVAN AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES. MY DARLING ROBERT SAID SHE NEVER DOUBTING IT IS YOU IT IS YOU. YES LITTLE SISTER SAID HE IT IS I AM HERE TO SAVE YOU ALL BUT BE VERY SILENT. BRAVE LAD REPEATED GLENARVAN. WATCH THE SAVAGES OUTSIDE SAID ROBERT. MULRADY WHOSE ATTENTION WAS DISTRACTED FOR A MOMENT BY THE APPEARANCE OF THE BOY RESUMED HIS POST. IT IS ALL RIGHT SAID HE THERE ARE ONLY FOUR AWAKE THE REST ARE ASLEEP
