THE WIND WAS FAIR NEVERTHELESS AND BLEW STEADILY FROM THE SOUTHWEST BUT THE CURRENTS WERE AGAINST THE SHIP'S COURSE AND SHE SCARCELY MADE ANY WAY. THE HEAVY LUMPY SEA STRAINED HER CORDAGE HER TIMBERS CREAKED AND SHE LABORED PAINFULLY IN THE TROUGH OF THE SEA. HER STANDING RIGGING WAS SO OUT OF ORDER THAT IT ALLOWED PLAY TO THE MASTS WHICH WERE VIOLENTLY SHAKEN AT EVERY ROLL OF THE SEA. FORTUNATELY WILL HALLEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESS OF CANVAS OR HIS MASTS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN. JOHN MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HULL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG. THEY OFTEN BRAVED THE WEATHER AND WENT ON THE POOP TILL DRIVEN DOWN AGAIN BY THE FORCE OF A SUDDEN SQUALL. THEN THEY RETURNED TO THE NARROW SPACE FITTER FOR STOWING CARGO THAN ACCOMMODATING PASSENGERS ESPECIALLY LADIES. THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE THEM. THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED. MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS. BESIDES THEY WERE GOING TO THIS NEW AND ILL REPUTED COUNTRY WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM WITHOUT CONVICTION NOT EVEN OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL BUT SOLELY AT THE BIDDING OF DESTINY. HE WAS RARELY TO BE SEEN BELOW. HE COULD NOT STAY IN ONE PLACE. HIS NERVOUS ORGANIZATION HIGHLY EXCITED COULD NOT SUBMIT TO CONFINEMENT BETWEEN FOUR NARROW BULKHEADS. HIS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON. HE SCANNED IT EAGERLY DURING EVERY SHORT INTERVAL OF CLEAR WEATHER. IT SEEMED AS IF HE SOUGHT TO QUESTION THE VOICELESS WATERS HE LONGED TO TEAR AWAY THE VEIL OF FOG AND VAPOR THAT OBSCURED HIS VIEW. HE COULD NOT BE RESIGNED AND HIS FEATURES EXPRESSED THE BITTERNESS OF HIS GRIEF. HE WAS A MAN OF ENERGY TILL NOW HAPPY AND POWERFUL AND DEPRIVED IN A MOMENT OF POWER AND HAPPINESS. JOHN CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID YOUR LORDSHIP IS LOOKING OUT FOR LAND. WE OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN THE LIGHTS OF AUCKLAND THIRTY SIX HOURS AGO. GLENARVAN MADE NO REPLY. THE LAND IS NOT ON THAT SIDE MY LORD SAID JOHN MANGLES LOOK MORE TO STARBOARD. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR THE LAND. WHAT THEN MY LORD. MY YACHT THE DUNCAN SAID GLENARVAN HOTLY. IT MUST BE HERE ON THESE COASTS SKIMMING THESE VERY WAVES PLAYING THE VILE PART OF A PIRATE. IT IS HERE JOHN I AM CERTAIN OF IT ON THE TRACK OF VESSELS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND AND I HAVE A PRESENTIMENT THAT WE SHALL FALL IN WITH HER. GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN. YOUR LORDSHIP FORGETS OUR POSITION. WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JOHN. YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN. WE SHOULD BE TAKEN DELIVERED UP TO THE MERCY OF THOSE WRETCHES AND BEN JOYCE HAS SHOWN US THAT HE DOES NOT STOP AT A CRIME. OUR LIVES WOULD BE WORTH LITTLE. WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT
