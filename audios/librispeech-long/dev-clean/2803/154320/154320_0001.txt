THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN THINK OF MARY GRANT. JOHN MY HEART IS BROKEN AND SOMETIMES DESPAIR NEARLY MASTERS ME. I FEEL AS IF FRESH MISFORTUNES AWAITED US AND THAT HEAVEN ITSELF IS AGAINST US IT TERRIFIES ME YOU MY LORD. NOT FOR MYSELF JOHN BUT FOR THOSE I LOVE WHOM YOU LOVE ALSO. KEEP UP YOUR HEART MY LORD SAID THE YOUNG CAPTAIN. WE MUST NOT LOOK OUT FOR TROUBLES. WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN. SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER. BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID. AND IF YOUR LORDSHIP IS BENT ON LOOKING OUT FOR HER LET IT BE IN ORDER TO GIVE HER A WIDE BERTH. THERE WAS EVERY REASON TO FEAR SUCH AN ENGAGEMENT IN THESE NARROW SEAS IN WHICH PIRATES COULD PLY THEIR TRADE WITHOUT RISK. HOWEVER FOR THAT DAY AT LEAST THE YACHT DID NOT APPEAR AND THE SIXTH NIGHT FROM THEIR DEPARTURE FROM TWOFOLD BAY CAME WITHOUT THE FEARS OF JOHN MANGLES BEING REALIZED
