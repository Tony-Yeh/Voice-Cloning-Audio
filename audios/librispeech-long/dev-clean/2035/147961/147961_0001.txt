THE COYOTES BROKE OUT AGAIN YAP YAP YAP THEN THE HIGH WHINE. PAVEL CALLED FOR SOMETHING AND STRUGGLED UP ON HIS ELBOW. WE SLID CLOSER TOGETHER ALONG THE BENCH. I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED. HIS SHIRT WAS HANGING OPEN AND HIS EMACIATED CHEST COVERED WITH YELLOW BRISTLE ROSE AND FELL HORRIBLY HE BEGAN TO COUGH. PETER SHUFFLED TO HIS FEET CAUGHT UP THE TEA KETTLE AND MIXED HIM SOME HOT WATER AND WHISKEY. THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM. PAVEL SNATCHED THE CUP AND DRANK THEN MADE PETER GIVE HIM THE BOTTLE AND SLIPPED IT UNDER HIS PILLOW GRINNING DISAGREEABLY AS IF HE HAD OUTWITTED SOME ONE. HIS EYES FOLLOWED PETER ABOUT THE ROOM WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS UNFRIENDLY EXPRESSION. IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE. PRESENTLY PAVEL BEGAN TO TALK TO MISTER SHIMERDA SCARCELY ABOVE A WHISPER. HE WAS TELLING A LONG STORY AND AS HE WENT ON ANTONIA TOOK MY HAND UNDER THE TABLE AND HELD IT TIGHT. SHE LEANED FORWARD AND STRAINED HER EARS TO HEAR HIM. HE GREW MORE AND MORE EXCITED AND KEPT POINTING ALL AROUND HIS BED AS IF THERE WERE THINGS THERE AND HE WANTED MISTER SHIMERDA TO SEE THEM. IT'S WOLVES JIMMY ANTONIA WHISPERED. THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST. HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONGED HIM. MISTER SHIMERDA CAUGHT HIM BY THE SHOULDERS BUT COULD HARDLY HOLD HIM IN BED. AT LAST HE WAS SHUT OFF BY A COUGHING FIT WHICH FAIRLY CHOKED HIM. HE PULLED A CLOTH FROM UNDER HIS PILLOW AND HELD IT TO HIS MOUTH. QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT. WHEN HE LAY DOWN AND TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL ALL THE RAGE HAD GONE OUT OF HIM. HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP. ANTONIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY. FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS. HIS SPINE AND SHOULDER BLADES STOOD OUT LIKE THE BONES UNDER THE HIDE OF A DEAD STEER LEFT IN THE FIELDS. THAT SHARP BACKBONE MUST HAVE HURT HIM WHEN HE LAY ON IT. GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US. WHATEVER IT WAS THE WORST WAS OVER. MISTER SHIMERDA SIGNED TO US THAT PAVEL WAS ASLEEP. WITHOUT A WORD PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN. MISTER SHIMERDA WENT WITH HIM. WE SAT AND WATCHED THE LONG BOWED BACK UNDER THE BLUE SHEET SCARCELY DARING TO BREATHE. ON THE WAY HOME WHEN WE WERE LYING IN THE STRAW UNDER THE JOLTING AND RATTLING ANTONIA TOLD ME AS MUCH OF THE STORY AS SHE COULD. WHAT SHE DID NOT TELL ME THEN SHE TOLD LATER WE TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE FOR DAYS AFTERWARD. WHEN PAVEL AND PETER WERE YOUNG MEN LIVING AT HOME IN RUSSIA THEY WERE ASKED TO BE GROOMSMEN FOR A FRIEND WHO WAS TO MARRY THE BELLE OF ANOTHER VILLAGE. IT WAS IN THE DEAD OF WINTER AND THE GROOM'S PARTY WENT OVER TO THE WEDDING IN SLEDGES. PETER AND PAVEL DROVE IN THE GROOM'S SLEDGE AND SIX SLEDGES FOLLOWED WITH ALL HIS RELATIVES AND FRIENDS. AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE. THE DINNER LASTED ALL AFTERNOON THEN IT BECAME A SUPPER AND CONTINUED FAR INTO THE NIGHT. THERE WAS MUCH DANCING AND DRINKING. AT MIDNIGHT THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE SAID GOOD BYE TO HER AND BLESSED HER. THE GROOM TOOK HER UP IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER OUT TO HIS SLEDGE AND TUCKED HER UNDER THE BLANKETS. HE SPRANG IN BESIDE HER AND PAVEL AND PETER OUR PAVEL AND PETER. TOOK THE FRONT SEAT PAVEL DROVE. THE PARTY SET OUT WITH SINGING AND THE JINGLE OF SLEIGH BELLS THE GROOM'S SLEDGE GOING FIRST. ALL THE DRIVERS WERE MORE OR LESS THE WORSE FOR MERRY MAKING AND THE GROOM WAS ABSORBED IN HIS BRIDE. THE WOLVES WERE BAD THAT WINTER AND EVERY ONE KNEW IT YET WHEN THEY HEARD THE FIRST WOLF CRY THE DRIVERS WERE NOT MUCH ALARMED. THEY HAD TOO MUCH GOOD FOOD AND DRINK INSIDE THEM. THE FIRST HOWLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS. THE WOLVES WERE COMING TOGETHER
