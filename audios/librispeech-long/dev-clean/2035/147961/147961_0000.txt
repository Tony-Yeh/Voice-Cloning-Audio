WHILE THE AUTUMN COLOR WAS GROWING PALE ON THE GRASS AND CORNFIELDS THINGS WENT BADLY WITH OUR FRIENDS THE RUSSIANS. PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER SHIMERDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONUS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE A MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW. PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER. HE ONLY KNEW THAT HE HAD FIRST BORROWED TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS THEN ANOTHER HUNDRED THEN FIFTY THAT EACH TIME A BONUS WAS ADDED TO THE PRINCIPAL AND THE DEBT GREW FASTER THAN ANY CROP HE PLANTED. NOW EVERYTHING WAS PLASTERED WITH MORTGAGES. SOON AFTER PETER RENEWED HIS NOTE PAVEL STRAINED HIMSELF LIFTING TIMBERS FOR A NEW BARN AND FELL OVER AMONG THE SHAVINGS WITH SUCH A GUSH OF BLOOD FROM THE LUNGS THAT HIS FELLOW WORKMEN THOUGHT HE WOULD DIE ON THE SPOT. THEY HAULED HIM HOME AND PUT HIM INTO HIS BED AND THERE HE LAY VERY ILL INDEED. MISFORTUNE SEEMED TO SETTLE LIKE AN EVIL BIRD ON THE ROOF OF THE LOG HOUSE AND TO FLAP ITS WINGS THERE WARNING HUMAN BEINGS AWAY. ONE AFTERNOON ANTONIA AND HER FATHER CAME OVER TO OUR HOUSE TO GET BUTTERMILK AND LINGERED AS THEY USUALLY DID UNTIL THE SUN WAS LOW. JUST AS THEY WERE LEAVING RUSSIAN PETER DROVE UP. PAVEL WAS VERY BAD HE SAID AND WANTED TO TALK TO MISTER SHIMERDA AND HIS DAUGHTER HE HAD COME TO FETCH THEM. MY PLAN MUST HAVE SEEMED VERY FOOLISH TO HER BUT SHE WAS OFTEN LARGE MINDED ABOUT HUMORING THE DESIRES OF OTHER PEOPLE. SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOUGHNUTS FOR US. MISTER SHIMERDA AND PETER WERE ON THE FRONT SEAT ANTONIA AND I SAT IN THE STRAW BEHIND AND ATE OUR LUNCH AS WE BUMPED ALONG. AFTER THE SUN SANK A COLD WIND SPRANG UP AND MOANED OVER THE PRAIRIE. IF THIS TURN IN THE WEATHER HAD COME SOONER I SHOULD NOT HAVE GOT AWAY. WE BURROWED DOWN IN THE STRAW AND CURLED UP CLOSE TOGETHER WATCHING THE ANGRY RED DIE OUT OF THE WEST AND THE STARS BEGIN TO SHINE IN THE CLEAR WINDY SKY. PETER KEPT SIGHING AND GROANING. TONY WHISPERED TO ME THAT HE WAS AFRAID PAVEL WOULD NEVER GET WELL. WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK. UP THERE THE STARS GREW MAGNIFICENTLY BRIGHT. THOUGH WE HAD COME FROM SUCH DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD IN BOTH OF US THERE WAS SOME DUSKY SUPERSTITION THAT THOSE SHINING GROUPS HAVE THEIR INFLUENCE UPON WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT TO BE. PERHAPS RUSSIAN PETER COME FROM FARTHER AWAY THAN ANY OF US HAD BROUGHT FROM HIS LAND TOO SOME SUCH BELIEF. THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW. THE RUDDY WINDOWS GUIDED US THE LIGHT FROM THE KITCHEN STOVE FOR THERE WAS NO LAMP BURNING. WE ENTERED SOFTLY. THE MAN IN THE WIDE BED SEEMED TO BE ASLEEP. TONY AND I SAT DOWN ON THE BENCH BY THE WALL AND LEANED OUR ARMS ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF US. THE FIRELIGHT FLICKERED ON THE HEWN LOGS THAT SUPPORTED THE THATCH OVERHEAD. PAVEL MADE A RASPING SOUND WHEN HE BREATHED AND HE KEPT MOANING WE WAITED. THE WIND SHOOK THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IMPATIENTLY THEN SWEPT ON AGAIN SINGING THROUGH THE BIG SPACES. EACH GUST AS IT BORE DOWN RATTLED THE PANES AND SWELLED OFF LIKE THE OTHERS. THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON. PRESENTLY IN ONE OF THOSE SOBBING INTERVALS BETWEEN THE BLASTS THE COYOTES TUNED UP WITH THEIR WHINING HOWL ONE TWO THREE THEN ALL TOGETHER TO TELL US THAT WINTER WAS COMING. THIS SOUND BROUGHT AN ANSWER FROM THE BED A LONG COMPLAINING CRY AS IF PAVEL WERE HAVING BAD DREAMS OR WERE WAKING TO SOME OLD MISERY. PETER LISTENED BUT DID NOT STIR. HE WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR BY THE KITCHEN STOVE
