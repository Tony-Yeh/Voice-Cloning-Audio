DURING THE AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES. HE SEEMED NOT TO CARE ABOUT ANYTHING. THE BLACK HAWK MONEY LENDER WHO HELD MORTGAGES ON PETER'S LIVE STOCK WAS THERE AND HE BOUGHT IN THE SALE NOTES AT ABOUT FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. EVERY ONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER. THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA. WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING. THIS CABIN WAS HIS HERMITAGE UNTIL THE WINTER SNOWS PENNED HIM IN HIS CAVE. FOR ANTONIA AND ME THE STORY OF THE WEDDING PARTY WAS NEVER AT AN END
