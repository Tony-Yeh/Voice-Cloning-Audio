THERE WAS NO MOON BUT THE STARLIGHT WAS CLEAR ON THE SNOW. A BLACK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY. THE WOLVES RAN LIKE STREAKS OF SHADOW THEY LOOKED NO BIGGER THAN DOGS BUT THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF THEM. SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HINDMOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD THE SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND OVERTURNED. THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MADE EVERYBODY SOBER. THE DRIVERS STOOD UP AND LASHED THEIR HORSES. THE GROOM HAD THE BEST TEAM AND HIS SLEDGE WAS LIGHTEST ALL THE OTHERS CARRIED FROM SIX TO A DOZEN PEOPLE. ANOTHER DRIVER LOST CONTROL THE SCREAMS OF THE HORSES WERE MORE TERRIBLE TO HEAR THAN THE CRIES OF THE MEN AND WOMEN. NOTHING SEEMED TO CHECK THE WOLVES. IT WAS HARD TO TELL WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE REAR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE FALLING BEHIND SHRIEKED AS PITEOUSLY AS THOSE WHO WERE ALREADY LOST. THE LITTLE BRIDE HID HER FACE ON THE GROOM'S SHOULDER AND SOBBED. PAVEL SAT STILL AND WATCHED HIS HORSES. THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GROOM'S THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND. IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO BE CALM AND TO GUIDE THEM CAREFULLY. AT LENGTH AS THEY BREASTED A LONG HILL PETER ROSE CAUTIOUSLY AND LOOKED BACK. THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGES LEFT HE WHISPERED. AND THE WOLVES PAVEL ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US. PAVEL REACHED THE BROW OF THE HILL BUT ONLY TWO SLEDGES FOLLOWED HIM DOWN THE OTHER SIDE. IN THAT MOMENT ON THE HILLTOP THEY SAW BEHIND THEM A WHIRLING BLACK GROUP ON THE SNOW. PRESENTLY THE GROOM SCREAMED. HE SPRANG UP AS IF HE MEANT TO JUMP BUT THE GIRL SHRIEKED AND HELD HIM BACK IT WAS EVEN THEN TOO LATE. THE BLACK GROUND SHADOWS WERE ALREADY CROWDING OVER THE HEAP IN THE ROAD AND ONE HORSE RAN OUT ACROSS THE FIELDS HIS HARNESS HANGING TO HIM WOLVES AT HIS HEELS. BUT THE GROOM'S MOVEMENT HAD GIVEN PAVEL AN IDEA. THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW. THE ONLY SLEDGE LEFT OUT OF SIX WAS NOT VERY FAR BEHIND THEM AND PAVEL'S MIDDLE HORSE WAS FAILING. BESIDE A FROZEN POND SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE OTHER SLEDGE PETER SAW IT PLAINLY. THREE BIG WOLVES GOT ABREAST OF THE HORSES AND THE HORSES WENT CRAZY. THEY TRIED TO JUMP OVER EACH OTHER GOT TANGLED UP IN THE HARNESS AND OVERTURNED THE SLEDGE. THEY STILL COME HE ASKED PETER. YES HOW MANY. TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH. NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO. PAVEL GAVE PETER THE REINS AND STEPPED CAREFULLY INTO THE BACK OF THE SLEDGE. HE CALLED TO THE GROOM THAT THEY MUST LIGHTEN AND POINTED TO THE BRIDE. THE YOUNG MAN CURSED HIM AND HELD HER TIGHTER. PAVEL TRIED TO DRAG HER AWAY IN THE STRUGGLE THE GROOM ROSE. PAVEL KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM. PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING. THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAR AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS. PAVEL AND PETER DROVE INTO THE VILLAGE ALONE AND THEY HAD BEEN ALONE EVER SINCE. THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE. PAVEL'S OWN MOTHER WOULD NOT LOOK AT HIM. THEY WENT AWAY TO STRANGE TOWNS BUT WHEN PEOPLE LEARNED WHERE THEY CAME FROM THEY WERE ALWAYS ASKED IF THEY KNEW THE TWO MEN WHO HAD FED THE BRIDE TO THE WOLVES. WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM. IT TOOK THEM FIVE YEARS TO SAVE MONEY ENOUGH TO COME TO AMERICA. THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINES FORT WAYNE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE. WHEN PAVEL'S HEALTH GREW SO BAD THEY DECIDED TO TRY FARMING. PAVEL DIED A FEW DAYS AFTER HE UNBURDENED HIS MIND TO MISTER SHIMERDA AND WAS BURIED IN THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD. PETER SOLD OFF EVERYTHING AND LEFT THE COUNTRY WENT TO BE COOK IN A RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION CAMP WHERE GANGS OF RUSSIANS WERE EMPLOYED. AT HIS SALE WE BOUGHT PETER'S WHEELBARROW AND SOME OF HIS HARNESS
