THE SAXONS OF KENT AND THE SOUTHERN KINGDOMS GENERALLY WERE CONVERTED BY MISSIONARIES FROM FRANCE OR ROME OR NATIVE PREACHERS OF THE FIRST OR SECOND CHRISTIAN GENERATION THOSE OF NORTHUMBRIA RECOGNISE AS THEIR APOSTLES SAINT AIDAN AND SAINT CUTHBERT TWO FATHERS FROM IONA. THE KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA AS THE NAME IMPLIES EMBRACED NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRY FROM THE HUMBER TO THE PICTISH BORDER. BEORT LANDED PROBABLY IN THE BOYNE AND SWEPT OVER THE RICH PLAIN OF MEATH WITH FIRE AND SWORD BURNING CHURCHES DRIVING OFF HERDS AND FLOCKS AND SLAUGHTERING THE CLERGY AND THE HUSBANDMEN. THE PIETY OF AN AFTER AGE SAW IN THE RETRIBUTION WHICH OVERTOOK EGFRID THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHEN HE WAS SLAIN BY THE PICTS AND SCOTS THE JUDGMENT OF HEAVEN AVENGING THE UNPROVOKED WRONGS OF THE IRISH. HIS SCOTTISH CONQUERORS RETURNING GOOD FOR EVIL CARRIED HIS BODY TO IONA WHERE IT WAS INTERRED WITH ALL DUE HONOUR. IONA WAS NOW IN THE ZENITH OF ITS GLORY. THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS. FIVE SUCCESSORS OF COLUMBKILL SLEPT IN PEACE AROUND THEIR HOLY FOUNDER AND A SIXTH EQUAL IN LEARNING AND SANCTITY TO ANY WHO PRECEDED HIM RECEIVED THE REMAINS OF KING EGFRID FROM THE HANDS OF HIS CONQUERORS. ADAMNAN REGARDED THE FATE OF EGFRID WE MAY BE SURE IN THE LIGHT OF A JUDGMENT ON HIM FOR HIS MISDEEDS AS BEDE AND BRITISH CHRISTIANS VERY GENERALLY DID. HE LEARNED TOO THAT THERE WERE IN NORTHUMBRIA SEVERAL CHRISTIAN CAPTIVES CARRIED OFF IN BEORT'S EXPEDITION AND PROBABLY SOLD INTO SLAVERY. NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FROM IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL. IN THE SAME SPIRIT ADAMNAN VOLUNTARILY UNDERTOOK A JOURNEY TO YORK WHERE ALDFRID A PRINCE EDUCATED IN IRELAND AND WHOSE ITINERARY OF IRELAND WE STILL HAVE NOW REIGNED. THE ABBOT OF IONA SUCCEEDED IN HIS HUMANE MISSION AND CROSSING OVER TO HIS NATIVE LAND HE RESTORED SIXTY OF THE CAPTIVES TO THEIR HOMES AND KINDRED. WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED ON THE RATH OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE. THE MILD MATERNAL GENIUS OF CHRISTIANITY IS FAITHFULLY EXHIBITED IN SUCH A LAW WHICH CONSUMMATES THE GLORY OF THE WORTHY SUCCESSOR OF COLUMBKILL. IT IS CURIOUS HERE TO OBSERVE THAT IT WAS NOT UNTIL ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS HAD PAST NOT TILL THE BEGINNING OF THE NINTH CENTURY THAT THE CLERGY WERE EXEMPT FROM MILITARY SERVICE. SO SLOW AND PATIENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY INFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE. THE ALL POWERFUL INTERCESSOR IN THIS CASE WAS SAINT MOLING OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF LEINSTER AND BISHOP OF FERNAMORE NOW FERNS. IN THE EARLY PART OF HIS REIGN FINNACTA SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN DISPOSED TO COLLECT THIS INVIDIOUS TAX BY FORCE BUT YIELDING TO OTHER MOTIVES HE AFTERWARDS TOOK A DIFFERENT VIEW OF HIS DUTY AND MARCHED INTO LEINSTER TO COMPEL ITS PAYMENT. HERE THE HOLY PRELATE OF FERNS MET HIM AND RELATED A VISION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DEMAND THE ABOLITION OF THE IMPOST. THE ABOLITION HE CONTENDED SHOULD NOT BE SIMPLY A SUSPENSION BUT FINAL AND FOR EVER. THE TRIBUTE WAS AT THIS PERIOD ENORMOUS FIFTEEN THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE ANNUALLY
