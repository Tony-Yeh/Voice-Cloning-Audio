THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES. THE LAST ARMED STRUGGLE OF DRUIDISM AND THE ONLY INVASION OF IRELAND BY THE ANGLO SAXONS ARE ALSO EVENTS OF THE CIVIL HISTORY OF THE SEVENTH CENTURY. OF THE SCHOOL AND THE SAINTS WE SHALL SPEAK HEREAFTER THE BATTLE DESERVES MORE IMMEDIATE MENTION. NOW THE HY NIAL FAMILY NOT ONLY HAD LONG GIVEN MONARCHS TO ALL IRELAND BUT HAD ALSO THE LION'S SHARE OF THEIR OWN PROVINCE AND KING DONALD AS THEIR HEAD COULD NOT PERMIT THEIR ASCENDENCY TO BE DISPUTED. THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER CONGAL SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LICENTIOUS BARDS WHEN UNDER THE BAN OF TARA AND HIS POPULARITY WITH THAT STILL POWERFUL ORDER WAS ONE PROP OF HIS AMBITION. IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MOIRA. CONGAL HAD RECRUITED NUMEROUS BANDS OF SAXONS BRITONS PICTS AND ARGYLE SCOTS WHO POURED INTO THE LARBOURS OF DOWN FOR MONTHS AND WERE MARSHALLED ON THE BANKS OF THE LAGAN TO SUSTAIN HIS CAUSE. THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF THIS MEMORABLE DAY. IT WAS WHAT MIGHT STRICTLY BE CALLED A PITCHED BATTLE TIME AND PLACE BEING FIXED BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. KING DONALD WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS BARD WHO DESCRIBED TO HIM AS THEY CAME IN SIGHT THE SEVERAL STANDARDS OF CONGAL'S HOST AND WHO SERVED UNDER THEM. THE CAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE CHURCH PREVAILED AND DRUIDISM MOURNED ITS LAST HOPE EXTINGUISHED ON THE PLAINS OF MOIRA IN THE DEATH OF CONGAL AND THE DEFEAT OF HIS VAST ARMY. KING DONALD RETURNED IN TRIUMPH TO CELEBRATE HIS VICTORY AT EMANIA AND TO RECEIVE THE BENEDICTION OF THE CHURCH AT ARMAGH. LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY REIGNED JOINTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURS AND CARES OF STATE. TO HEIGHTEN THE AWFUL SENSE OF INEVITABLE DOOM AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OCCURRED CONCURRENTLY WITH THE APPEARANCE OF THE PESTILENCE ON THE FIRST SUNDAY IN MAY. IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SUN GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEARTS STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BEL MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION IN THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVERTHROW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE. AMONG THE VICTIMS OF THIS FEARFUL VISITATION WHICH LIKE THE MODERN CHOLERA SWEPT THROUGH ALL RANKS AND CLASSES OF SOCIETY AND RETURNED IN THE SAME TRACK FOR SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE SEASONS WERE VERY MANY OF THOSE VENERATED MEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION OF THE ABBOTS AND BISHOPS. THE MUNSTER KING AND MANY OF THE CHIEFTAIN CLASS SHARED THE COMMON LOT. LASTLY THE ROYAL BROTHERS FELL THEMSELVES VICTIMS TO THE EPIDEMIC WHICH SO SADLY SIGNALIZES THEIR REIGN. THE ONLY CONFLICTS THAT OCCURRED ON IRISH SOIL WITH A PICTISH OR AN ANGLO SAXON FORCE IF WE EXCEPT THOSE WHO FORMED A CONTINGENT OF CONGAL'S ARMY AT MOIRA OCCURRED IN THE TIME OF THE HOSPITABLE FINNACTA. AS LEADING TO THE MENTION OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS WE MUST SET THIS INROAD CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER. THE SAXONS HAD NOW BEEN FOR FOUR CENTURIES IN BRITAIN THE OLDER INHABITANTS OF WHICH CELTS LIKE THE GAULS AND IRISH THEY HAD CRUELLY HARASSED JUST AS THE MILESIAN IRISH OPPRESSED THEIR BELGIC PREDECESSORS AND AS THE NORMANS IN TURN WILL BE FOUND OPPRESSING BOTH CELT AND SAXON IN ENGLAND AND IRELAND
