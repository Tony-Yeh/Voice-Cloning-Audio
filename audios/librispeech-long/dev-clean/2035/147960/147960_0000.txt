SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTECTING MANNER. BEFORE THE AUTUMN WAS OVER SHE BEGAN TO TREAT ME MORE LIKE AN EQUAL AND TO DEFER TO ME IN OTHER THINGS THAN READING LESSONS. THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER. ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE SHIMERDAS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBROSCH NEEDED. I OFFERED TO TAKE HER ON THE PONY AND SHE GOT UP BEHIND ME. THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEADY AS WINE. WITHIN A WEEK ALL THE BLOOMING ROADS HAD BEEN DESPOILED HUNDREDS OF MILES OF YELLOW SUNFLOWERS HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO BROWN RATTLING BURRY STALKS. WE FOUND RUSSIAN PETER DIGGING HIS POTATOES. AS WE RODE AWAY WITH THE SPADE ANTONIA SUGGESTED THAT WE STOP AT THE PRAIRIE DOG TOWN AND DIG INTO ONE OF THE HOLES. WE COULD FIND OUT WHETHER THEY RAN STRAIGHT DOWN OR WERE HORIZONTAL LIKE MOLE HOLES WHETHER THEY HAD UNDERGROUND CONNECTIONS WHETHER THE OWLS HAD NESTS DOWN THERE LINED WITH FEATHERS. WE MIGHT GET SOME PUPPIES OR OWL EGGS OR SNAKE SKINS. THE DOG TOWN WAS SPREAD OUT OVER PERHAPS TEN ACRES. THE GRASS HAD BEEN NIBBLED SHORT AND EVEN SO THIS STRETCH WAS NOT SHAGGY AND RED LIKE THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY BUT GRAY AND VELVETY. THE HOLES WERE SEVERAL YARDS APART AND WERE DISPOSED WITH A GOOD DEAL OF REGULARITY ALMOST AS IF THE TOWN HAD BEEN LAID OUT IN STREETS AND AVENUES. ONE ALWAYS FELT THAT AN ORDERLY AND VERY SOCIABLE KIND OF LIFE WAS GOING ON THERE. I PICKETED DUDE DOWN IN A DRAW AND WE WENT WANDERING ABOUT LOOKING FOR A HOLE THAT WOULD BE EASY TO DIG. THE DOGS WERE OUT AS USUAL DOZENS OF THEM SITTING UP ON THEIR HIND LEGS OVER THE DOORS OF THEIR HOUSES. AS WE APPROACHED THEY BARKED SHOOK THEIR TAILS AT US AND SCURRIED UNDERGROUND. BEFORE THE MOUTHS OF THE HOLES WERE LITTLE PATCHES OF SAND AND GRAVEL SCRATCHED UP WE SUPPOSED FROM A LONG WAY BELOW THE SURFACE. HERE AND THERE IN THE TOWN WE CAME ON LARGER GRAVEL PATCHES SEVERAL YARDS AWAY FROM ANY HOLE. IF THE DOGS HAD SCRATCHED THE SAND UP IN EXCAVATING HOW HAD THEY CARRIED IT SO FAR. IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVEL BEDS THAT I MET MY ADVENTURE. WE WERE EXAMINING A BIG HOLE WITH TWO ENTRANCES. THE BURROW SLOPED INTO THE GROUND AT A GENTLE ANGLE SO THAT WE COULD SEE WHERE THE TWO CORRIDORS UNITED AND THE FLOOR WAS DUSTY FROM USE LIKE A LITTLE HIGHWAY OVER WHICH MUCH TRAVEL WENT. I WAS WALKING BACKWARD IN A CROUCHING POSITION WHEN I HEARD ANTONIA SCREAM. SHE WAS STANDING OPPOSITE ME POINTING BEHIND ME AND SHOUTING SOMETHING IN BOHEMIAN. I WHIRLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN. HE WAS SUNNING HIMSELF AFTER THE COLD NIGHT AND HE MUST HAVE BEEN ASLEEP WHEN ANTONIA SCREAMED. WHEN I TURNED HE WAS LYING IN LONG LOOSE WAVES LIKE A LETTER W HE TWITCHED AND BEGAN TO COIL SLOWLY. HE WAS NOT MERELY A BIG SNAKE I THOUGHT HE WAS A CIRCUS MONSTROSITY. HIS ABOMINABLE MUSCULARITY HIS LOATHSOME FLUID MOTION SOMEHOW MADE ME SICK. I SAW HIS COILS TIGHTEN NOW HE WOULD SPRING SPRING HIS LENGTH I REMEMBERED. I RAN UP AND DROVE AT HIS HEAD WITH MY SPADE STRUCK HIM FAIRLY ACROSS THE NECK AND IN A MINUTE HE WAS ALL ABOUT MY FEET IN WAVY LOOPS. I STRUCK NOW FROM HATE. ANTONIA BAREFOOTED AS SHE WAS RAN UP BEHIND ME. EVEN AFTER I HAD POUNDED HIS UGLY HEAD FLAT HIS BODY KEPT ON COILING AND WINDING DOUBLING AND FALLING BACK ON ITSELF. I WALKED AWAY AND TURNED MY BACK I FELT SEASICK. I KNOW I AM JUST AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED
