I SUPPOSE I LOOKED AS SICK AS I FELT. I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY. NOW WE TAKE THAT SNAKE HOME AND SHOW EVERYBODY. NOBODY AIN'T SEEN IN THIS KAWN TREE SO BIG SNAKE LIKE YOU KILL. SHE WENT ON IN THIS STRAIN UNTIL I BEGAN TO THINK THAT I HAD LONGED FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND HAD HAILED IT WITH JOY. CAUTIOUSLY WE WENT BACK TO THE SNAKE HE WAS STILL GROPING WITH HIS TAIL TURNING UP HIS UGLY BELLY IN THE LIGHT. A FAINT FETID SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUID OOZED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD. LOOK TONY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID. I TOOK A LONG PIECE OF STRING FROM MY POCKET AND SHE LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH THE SPADE WHILE I TIED A NOOSE AROUND IT. WE PULLED HIM OUT STRAIGHT AND MEASURED HIM BY MY RIDING QUIRT HE WAS ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF FEET LONG. HE HAD TWELVE RATTLES BUT THEY WERE BROKEN OFF BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO TAPER SO I INSISTED THAT HE MUST ONCE HAVE HAD TWENTY FOUR. I EXPLAINED TO ANTONIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO AND INDIAN TIMES. AS I TURNED HIM OVER I BEGAN TO FEEL PROUD OF HIM TO HAVE A KIND OF RESPECT FOR HIS AGE AND SIZE. HE SEEMED LIKE THE ANCIENT ELDEST EVIL. CERTAINLY HIS KIND HAVE LEFT HORRIBLE UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES IN ALL WARM BLOODED LIFE. WE DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE DUDE HOME AND I WOULD WALK. I FOLLOWED WITH THE SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAGGING MY SNAKE. HER EXULTATION WAS CONTAGIOUS. IF THE RED GRASS WERE FULL OF RATTLERS I WAS EQUAL TO THEM ALL. NEVERTHELESS I STOLE FURTIVE GLANCES BEHIND ME NOW AND THEN TO SEE THAT NO AVENGING MATE OLDER AND BIGGER THAN MY QUARRY WAS RACING UP FROM THE REAR. OTTO FUCHS WAS THE FIRST ONE WE MET. HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE CATTLE POND HAVING A QUIET PIPE BEFORE SUPPER. ANTONIA CALLED HIM TO COME QUICK AND LOOK. HE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING FOR A MINUTE BUT SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND TURNED THE SNAKE OVER WITH HIS BOOT. WHERE DID YOU RUN ONTO THAT BEAUTY JIM. UP AT THE DOG TOWN I ANSWERED LACONICALLY. WE'D BEEN UP TO RUSSIAN PETER'S TO BORROW A SPADE FOR AMBROSCH. IT WAS JUST LUCK YOU HAD A TOOL HE SAID CAUTIOUSLY. HE COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DID HE FIGHT HARD. ANTONIA BROKE IN HE FIGHT SOMETHING AWFUL HE IS ALL OVER JIMMY'S BOOTS I SCREAM FOR HIM TO RUN BUT HE JUST HIT AND HIT THAT SNAKE LIKE HE WAS CRAZY. OTTO WINKED AT ME. SUBSEQUENT EXPERIENCES WITH RATTLESNAKES TAUGHT ME THAT MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WAS FORTUNATE IN CIRCUMSTANCE. MY BIG RATTLER WAS OLD AND HAD LED TOO EASY A LIFE THERE WAS NOT MUCH FIGHT IN HIM. A SNAKE OF HIS SIZE IN FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HANDLE. SO IN REALITY IT WAS A MOCK ADVENTURE THE GAME WAS FIXED FOR ME BY CHANCE AS IT PROBABLY WAS FOR MANY A DRAGON SLAYER. I HAD BEEN ADEQUATELY ARMED BY RUSSIAN PETER THE SNAKE WAS OLD AND LAZY AND I HAD ANTONIA BESIDE ME TO APPRECIATE AND ADMIRE. THIS WAS ENOUGH FOR ANTONIA. SHE LIKED ME BETTER FROM THAT TIME ON AND SHE NEVER TOOK A SUPERCILIOUS AIR WITH ME AGAIN
