THE LITTLE MAID WHO WAS WISE. THE STORY OF A ROBBER WHO WAS OUTWITTED. LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS. EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON AN ACCOUNT. HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS REMAINED AT HOME AND ALL WENT WELL UNTIL ONE SAD DAY THE WIFE DIED. THAT YEAR THE MERCHANT LOOKED FORWARD TO HIS JOURNEY WITH DREAD FOR HE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE HIS DAUGHTERS ALONE. I CANNOT BEAR TO GO AWAY HE SAID TO THEM. MY HEART IS FILLED WITH FEAR LEST SOME EVIL MAY BEFALL YOU DURING MY ABSENCE. HE WORRIED ABOUT THE MATTER NIGHT AND DAY. HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU. BE SURE THAT YOU ADMIT NO ONE COMMANDED THE MERCHANT. THEY GAVE HIM THEIR PROMISE AND HE STARTED ON HIS JOURNEY. NEVERTHELESS HE WENT WITH AN ANXIOUS HEART. NOW OUTSIDE THIS CITY THERE WAS A BAND OF BOLD ROBBERS. THE CAPTAIN OF THE BAND HAD WATCHED THE MERCHANT'S DEPARTURE AND WHEN HE WAS SAFELY AWAY THE THIEF DRESSED HIMSELF IN THE DISGUISE OF AN OLD BEGGAR. WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NEARBY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR. HAVE PITY UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT. IT IS RAINING OUTSIDE AND NO ONE WITH MERCY IN HIS HEART COULD TURN AWAY ONE WHO BEGS SHELTER FROM THE STORM. LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF. IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS. I THINK WE OUGHT TO TAKE PITY ON A POOR BEGGAR A NIGHT LIKE THIS. THE SECOND DAUGHTER PEEPED OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE BEGGAR. HE IS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID. OUR FATHER HAS ALWAYS TAUGHT US TO SHOW MERCY AND KINDNESS TO THE AGED. REMEMBER OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST ONE. WE GAVE HIM OUR WORD THAT WE WOULD ADMIT NO ONE. THE ELDEST DAUGHTER FROWNED. IT IS NOT FOR THE YOUNGEST AND MOST CHILDISH ONE OF US TO MAKE THE PLANS SHE SAID THE SECOND DAUGHTER ADDED. WE TWO ARE OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE. IT IS FOR US TO DETERMINE WHAT SHALL BE DONE. IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT. BUI WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER. HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BEGGAR. THEY LED HIM INTO THE KITCHEN TO DRY HIS CLOTHES. THEN THEY MADE READY A BED FOR HIM TO SLEEP UPON. THEY GAVE HIM HIS SUPPER IN THE KITCHEN AND THEN THEY ATE THEIR OWN. IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING. A PROMISE IS A PROMISE NEVERTHELESS SAID THE YOUNGEST. WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BEGGAR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM. THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY. AS SOON AS THEY HAD EATEN THE GIRLS WENT TO THEIR ROOM AND THE TWO ELDEST WERE OVERCOME WITH SLEEP ALMOST BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO GET INTO BED. THE YOUNGEST ONE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP A SINGLE WINK. SOON SHE HEARD FOOTSTEPS THE BEGGAR ENTERED THE ROOM. THE YOUNGEST ONE PRETENDED THAT SHE TOO WAS ASLEEP. THE MAN WENT TO THE BED OF THE ELDEST SISTER AND STUCK A PIN INTO HER FOOT TO SEE IF SHE WERE COMPLETELY UNCONSCIOUS. SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK. THEN HE WENT TO THE BED OF THE SECOND SISTER AND DID THE SAME. SHE WAS AS COMPLETELY UNCONSCIOUS AS HER SISTER
