THE ROBBER THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS AS COMPLETELY OVERCOME BY THE SLEEPING POWDER AS THE OTHERS. THE YOUNGEST SISTER PEEPED THROUGH HER LONG HEAVY EYELASHES AND WATCHED THE BEGGAR. SHE SAW TO HER SURPRISE THAT HE HAD LAID ASIDE THE HEAVY RAGGED OLD COAT WHICH HE HAD KEPT WRAPPED ABOUT HIM EVEN WHILE HE ATE. UNDERNEATH HE WAS DRESSED LIKE A ROBBER WITH A SWORD PISTOLS AND DAGGER. SHE WAS SO TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED THAT IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP HER TEETH FROM CHATTERING. SHE HEARD THE ROBBER GO ABOUT THE HOUSE PICKING OUT THE VALUABLES WHICH HE WANTED TO STEAL. THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE. SHE KNEW THAT THE THIEF HAD BROUGHT BACK OTHERS WITH HIM. IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN. I KNEW ALL THE TIME THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO LET ME IN. I WAS SUSPICIOUS OF HER FROM THE FIRST. PERHAPS YOU CAN OUTWIT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER. THE LEADER OF THE BAND OF THIEVES WENT UP CLOSE TO THE KEYHOLE AND WHISPERED KIND LADY OF THE HOUSE HAVE PITY ON ME. THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED. I HAVE LEFT MY CHARM BEHIND HE CRIED PRAY LET ME ENTER TO GET IT. I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO YOU NO HARM. I DO NOT TRUST YOUR PROMISES REPLIED THE LITTLE MAID. YOU SHALL NOT COME INTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE. PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER. IT'S IN THE FIRE REPLIED THE GIRL. GO THROW VINEGAR ON THE FIRE AND PUT IT OUT SAID THE CAPTAIN OF THE THIEVES. THEN YOU CAN PULL MY CHARM OUT IN SAFETY. NOW IT HAPPENED THAT THERE WAS A LITTLE HOLE IN THE DOOR JUST LARGE ENOUGH FOR A MAN'S HAND TO ENTER. IT IS THE HOLE THROUGH WHICH BEGGARS OFTEN THRUST OUTSTRETCHED HANDS ASKING FOR ALMS. PUT YOUR HAND THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE DOOR REPLIED THE LITTLE MAID THEN I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR CHARM. SHE QUICKLY RAN UPSTAIRS AND GOT THE ROBBER'S SWORD WHICH HE HAD LEFT ON A CHAIR IN THE DINING ROOM. WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE DOOR. SHE STRUCK IT WITH ALL HER MIGHT WITH THE GREAT SWORD AND CUT IT OFF. THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR. THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT DOORS. THE DOORS WERE STRONG AND HELD SECURELY. AT LAST IT WAS DAYLIGHT AND THE BAND OF THIEVES HAD TO FLEE. OH WHY DID WE EVER LET THE MAN INTO OUR HOUSE CRIED THE ELDEST. OH WHY DIDN'T WE KEEP OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE MIDDLE ONE. WHEN AT LAST THE MERCHANT RETURNED FROM THE DISTANT CITY WHERE HE HAD BEEN TO COLLECT MONEY HE WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND HIS HOUSE AND HIS THREE DAUGHTERS SAFE. I SEE THAT NO HARM BEFELL YOU IN MY ABSENCE HE SAID AS HE EMBRACED THEM FONDLY. ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH. THE ELDEST DAUGHTER BLUSHED AND HUNG HER HEAD. GREAT DANGER THREATENED US WHILE YOU WERE AWAY SHE SAID. THANKS TO OUR YOUNGEST SISTER WE ARE SAFE. OUR LITTLE SISTER WAS WISER THAN WE WERE SAID THE MIDDLE DAUGHTER
