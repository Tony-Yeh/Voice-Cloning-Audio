HANSEL KEPT SAYING TO GRETHEL WE WILL SOON FIND THE WAY BUT THEY DID NOT AND THEY WALKED THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG AND THE NEXT DAY BUT STILL THEY DID NOT COME OUT OF THE WOOD AND THEY GOT VERY HUNGRY FOR THEY HAD NOTHING TO EAT BUT THE BERRIES WHICH THEY FOUND UPON THE BUSHES. IT SOON CEASED AND SPREADING ITS WINGS FLEW OFF AND THEY FOLLOWED IT UNTIL IT ARRIVED AT A COTTAGE UPON THE ROOF OF WHICH IT PERCHED AND WHEN THEY WENT CLOSE UP TO IT THEY SAW THAT THE COTTAGE WAS MADE OF BREAD AND CAKES AND THE WINDOW PANES WERE OF CLEAR SUGAR. WE WILL GO IN HERE SAID HANSEL AND HAVE A GLORIOUS FEAST. I WILL EAT A PIECE OF THE ROOF AND YOU CAN EAT THE WINDOW WILL THEY NOT BE SWEET. SO HANSEL REACHED UP AND BROKE A PIECE OFF THE ROOF IN ORDER TO SEE HOW IT TASTED WHILE GRETHEL STEPPED UP TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO BITE IT. HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETHEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY. JUST THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND A VERY OLD WOMAN WALKING UPON CRUTCHES CAME OUT. HANSEL AND GRETHEL WERE SO MUCH FRIGHTENED THAT THEY LET FALL WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR HANDS BUT THE OLD WOMAN NODDING HER HEAD SAID AH YOU DEAR CHILDREN WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE. COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE. A GOOD MEAL OF MILK AND PANCAKES WITH SUGAR APPLES AND NUTS WAS SPREAD ON THE TABLE AND IN THE BACK ROOM WERE TWO NICE LITTLE BEDS COVERED WITH WHITE WHERE HANSEL AND GRETHEL LAID THEMSELVES DOWN AND WERE HAPPY AS COULD BE. THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAY LAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREADHOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY. WHEN HANSEL AND GRETHEL CAME NEAR THE WITCH'S HOUSE SHE LAUGHED WICKEDLY SAYING HERE COME TWO WHO SHALL NOT ESCAPE ME. AND EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE THEY AWOKE SHE WENT UP TO THEM AND SAW HOW LOVINGLY THEY LAY SLEEPING WITH THEIR CHUBBY RED CHEEKS AND SHE MUMBLED TO HERSELF THAT WILL BE A GOOD BITE. THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE. GRETHEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED. SO A NICE MEAL WAS COOKED FOR HANSEL BUT GRETHEL GOT NOTHING ELSE BUT A CRAB'S CLAW. EVERY MORNING THE OLD WITCH CAME TO THE CAGE AND SAID HANSEL STRETCH OUT YOUR FINGER THAT I MAY FEEL WHETHER YOU ARE GETTING FAT. BUT HANSEL USED TO STRETCH OUT A BONE AND THE OLD WOMAN HAVING VERY BAD SIGHT THOUGHT IT WAS HIS FINGER AND WONDERED VERY MUCH WHY HE DID NOT GET FAT. GRETHEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM. DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED. SO EARLY IN THE MORNING GRETHEL WAS COMPELLED TO GO OUT AND FILL THE KETTLE AND MAKE A FIRE. FIRST WE WILL BAKE HOWEVER SAID THE OLD WOMAN I HAVE ALREADY HEATED THE OVEN AND KNEADED THE DOUGH AND SO SAYING SHE PUSHED POOR GRETHEL UP TO THE OVEN OUT OF WHICH THE FLAMES WERE BURNING FIERCELY. CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETHEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL. YOU STUPID GOOSE SAID SHE THE OPENING IS BIG ENOUGH. SEE I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF. AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN. SO HE SPRANG OUT LIKE A BIRD FROM HIS CAGE WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND THEY WERE SO GLAD THAT THEY FELL UPON EACH OTHER'S NECK AND KISSED EACH OTHER OVER AND OVER AGAIN
