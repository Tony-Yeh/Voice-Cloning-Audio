ONCE UPON A TIME THERE DWELT NEAR A LARGE WOOD A POOR WOOD CUTTER WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN BY HIS FORMER MARRIAGE A LITTLE BOY CALLED HANSEL AND A GIRL NAMED GRETHEL. HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US. HOW CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES. OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLANE THE COFFINS FOR US. BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN. GRETHEL WEPT BITTERLY AND SAID TO HANSEL WHAT WILL BECOME OF US. BE QUIET GRETHEL SAID HE DO NOT CRY I WILL HELP YOU. AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT. THE MOON SHONE BRIGHTLY AND THE WHITE PEBBLES WHICH LAY BEFORE THE DOOR SEEMED LIKE SILVER PIECES THEY GLITTERED SO BRIGHTLY. AND SO SAYING HE WENT TO BED AGAIN. THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE SUN AROSE THE WIFE WENT AND AWOKE THE TWO CHILDREN. GET UP YOU LAZY THINGS WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO CHOP WOOD. THEN SHE GAVE THEM EACH A PIECE OF BREAD SAYING THERE IS SOMETHING FOR YOUR DINNER DO NOT EAT IT BEFORE THE TIME FOR YOU WILL GET NOTHING ELSE. AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE. BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH. THEN THEY SET FIRE TO THEM AND AS THE FLAME BURNT UP HIGH THE WIFE SAID NOW YOU CHILDREN LIE DOWN NEAR THE FIRE AND REST YOURSELVES WHILST WE GO INTO THE FOREST AND CHOP MORE WOOD WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND CALL YOU. HANSEL AND GRETHEL SAT DOWN BY THE FIRE AND WHEN IT WAS NOON EACH ATE THE PIECE OF BREAD AND BECAUSE THEY COULD HEAR THE BLOWS OF AN AXE THEY THOUGHT THEIR FATHER WAS NEAR BUT IT WAS NOT AN AXE BUT A BRANCH WHICH HE HAD BOUND TO AN OLD TREE SO AS TO BE BLOWN TO AND FRO BY THE WIND. WHEN THEY AWOKE IT WAS QUITE DARK AND GRETHEL BEGAN TO CRY. HOW SHALL WE GET OUT OF THE WOOD. BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN. HIS WIFE HOWEVER WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING THAT HE SAID AND SCOLDED AND REPROACHED HIM WITHOUT END. HE WHO SAYS A MUST SAY B TOO AND HE WHO CONSENTS THE FIRST TIME MUST ALSO THE SECOND. EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE. ON THE WAY HANSEL BROKE HIS IN HIS POCKET AND STOPPING EVERY NOW AND THEN DROPPED A CRUMB UPON THE PATH. HANSEL WHY DO YOU STOP AND LOOK ABOUT SAID THE FATHER KEEP IN THE PATH. I AM LOOKING AT MY LITTLE DOVE ANSWERED HANSEL NODDING A GOOD BYE TO ME. BUT HANSEL KEPT STILL DROPPING CRUMBS AS HE WENT ALONG. WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN. WHEN NOON CAME GRETHEL SHARED HER BREAD WITH HANSEL WHO HAD STREWN HIS ON THE PATH. THEY THEN WENT TO SLEEP BUT THE EVENING ARRIVED AND NO ONE CAME TO VISIT THE POOR CHILDREN AND IN THE DARK NIGHT THEY AWOKE AND HANSEL COMFORTED HIS SISTER BY SAYING ONLY WAIT GRETHEL TILL THE MOON COMES OUT THEN WE SHALL SEE THE CRUMBS OF BREAD WHICH I HAVE DROPPED AND THEY WILL SHOW US THE WAY HOME. THE MOON SHONE AND THEY GOT UP BUT THEY COULD NOT SEE ANY CRUMBS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS WHICH HAD BEEN FLYING ABOUT IN THE WOODS AND FIELDS HAD PICKED THEM ALL UP
