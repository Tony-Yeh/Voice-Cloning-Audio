AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES. THESE ARE BETTER THAN PEBBLES SAID HANSEL PUTTING AS MANY INTO HIS POCKET AS IT WOULD HOLD WHILE GRETHEL THOUGHT I WILL TAKE SOME HOME TOO AND FILLED HER APRON FULL. WE MUST BE OFF NOW SAID HANSEL AND GET OUT OF THIS ENCHANTED FOREST BUT WHEN THEY HAD WALKED FOR TWO HOURS THEY CAME TO A LARGE PIECE OF WATER. WE CANNOT GET OVER SAID HANSEL I CAN SEE NO BRIDGE AT ALL. AND THERE IS NO BOAT EITHER SAID GRETHEL BUT THERE SWIMS A WHITE DUCK I WILL ASK HER TO HELP US OVER AND SHE SANG. NO REPLIED GRETHEL THAT WILL BE TOO MUCH FOR THE DUCK SHE SHALL TAKE US OVER ONE AT A TIME. THIS THE GOOD LITTLE BIRD DID AND WHEN BOTH WERE HAPPILY ARRIVED ON THE OTHER SIDE AND HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY THEY CAME TO A WELL KNOWN WOOD WHICH THEY KNEW THE BETTER EVERY STEP THEY WENT AND AT LAST THEY PERCEIVED THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE. THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK. HE HAD NOT HAD ONE HAPPY HOUR SINCE HE HAD LEFT THE CHILDREN IN THE FOREST AND HIS WIFE WAS DEAD
