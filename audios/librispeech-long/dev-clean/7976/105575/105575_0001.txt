THE ENEMY LOST MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND MEN IN TRYING TO DESTROY THAT SINGLE BRIGADE AND ITS OHIO BATTERY. THE BURYING PARTY THE NEXT MORNING FOUND NINETEEN DEAD REBELS LYING TOGETHER AT ONE PLACE. AT ANOTHER SPOT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO REBEL CORPSES LAY IN A ROW COVERED BY TARPAULINS. THE ENEMY HAD NOT HAD TIME TO BURY THEM. THE NIGHT BEFORE THE BATTLE OF CORINTH THE FIFTH IOWA REGIMENT LAY ACROSS THE PURDY ROAD IN THE BRIGHT MOONLIGHT. I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH A COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR JIMMY KING. HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION IN MISSISSIPPI. WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTER LEFT WE GETTING THE WORST OF IT TOO. THE REBELS WERE CHARGING WORKS THAT THEY THEMSELVES HAD BUILT WHEN THEY HELD THE TOWN DURING HALLECK'S SIEGE. GENERAL HACCELMAN AND MANY OTHER OF OUR OFFICERS HAD FALLEN. OUR OWN DIVISION THOUGH FIGHTING SOME HAD LOST BUT FEW MEN. THAT EVENING AN ORDER CAME FOR US HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO ASSAULT THE ENEMY'S LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT. BEFORE THE HOUR CAME HOWEVER THE MOVE WAS DECIDED TO BE TOO DANGEROUS AND WE CHANGED OUR POSITION TO ONE NEARER THE FORTS. ALL THE NIGHT WE LAY THERE UNDER THE BRIGHTEST MOONLIGHT I EVER SAW. UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THE VICTORIOUS REBEL ARMY. THEY BELIEVED CORINTH AS GOOD AS TAKEN BUT THEY HAD ONLY CAPTURED OUR OUTER LINES OF FORTS. YET IT LOOKED VERY BAD FOR US. EVERY HOUSE IN TOWN WAS FULL OF OUR WOUNDED AND OUR DEAD LAY EVERYWHERE. ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD TISHIMINGO HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST. NEVER WILL I FORGET THE HORRIBLE SCENES OF THAT NIGHT. THE TOWN SEEMED FULL OF THE GROANS OF DYING MEN. I COULD NOT HELP MY FRIEND. IT WAS TOO LATE FOR HE WAS DYING. GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID SMILING ALL WILL BE NEEDED. IT WAS A RELIEF TO ME TO GET BACK INTO THE MOONLIGHT AND OUT OF THE HORROR YET OUT THERE LAY THOUSANDS OF OTHERS IN LINE ONLY WAITING THE DAYLIGHT TO BE ALSO MANGLED AND TORN LIKE THESE. THE MOON SHONE SO BRIGHTLY THE MEN IN THE LINES TIRED THOUGH THEY WERE COULD SCARCELY SLEEP. AT EARLY DAYBREAK I AGAIN WENT TO SEE MY LIEUTENANT. AS I ENTERED THE BUILDING A CANNONBALL FROM THE ENEMY CRASHED THROUGH THE HOUSE AND KILLED FOUR SOLDIERS BY THE STAIRWAY. MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED OUT TO DIE ELSEWHERE. IT WAS SOON FULL DAY. IN ONE OF THE ROOMS I SAW THE FLOORS TABLES AND CHAIRS COVERED WITH AMPUTATED LIMBS SOME WHITE AND SOME BROKEN AND BLEEDING. THERE WERE SIMPLY BUSHELS OF THEM AND THE FLOOR WAS RUNNING BLOOD. IT WAS A STRANGE HORRIBLE SIGHT BUT IT WAS WAR YES IT WAS HELL. I HASTENED BACK TO THE LINES. NINE O'CLOCK CAME AND NOW WE KNEW THAT THE GREAT ASSAULT WAS TO BE MADE. WE LOOKED FOR IT AGAINST OUR OWN DIVISION AS WE LAY IN THE GRASS WAITING. SUDDENLY WE HEARD SOMETHING ALMOST LIKE A DISTANT WHIRLWIND. MY REGIMENT ROSE TO ITS FEET FIRED A FEW MOMENTS AT SCATTERING REBELS IN OUR FRONT AND WERE AMAZED TO SEE A GREAT BLACK COLUMN TEN THOUSAND STRONG MOVING LIKE A MIGHTY STORM CLOUD OUT OF THE WOODS AND ATTACKING THE FORTS AND TROOPS AT OUR LEFT. IT WAS THE STORMING OF FORT ROBINETT. THE CLOUD OF REBELS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS. THESE RECKLESSLY ADVANCED ON THE FORTS CLIMBING OVER THE FALLEN TREES AND BENDING THEIR HEADS AGAINST THE AWFUL STORM OF GRAPE AND CANISTER FROM ALL OUR CANNON
