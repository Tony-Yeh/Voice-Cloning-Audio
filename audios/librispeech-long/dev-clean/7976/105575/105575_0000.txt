ALL THAT SUMMER AFTER TAKING CORINTH WE CHASED UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI TRYING TO GET FAIR BATTLE WITH THE REBEL ARMY. IT WAS FOUGHT BY A HANDFUL OF THE TROOPS OF GENERAL ROSECRANS AGAINST HALF THE ARMY OF GENERAL PRICE. GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FOUGHT BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER. HOW EAGERLY THE REGIMENT MADE THE FORWARD MARCH ON THAT BEAUTIFUL AUTUMN DAY. THE WOODS WERE IN THEIR FAIREST FOLIAGE AND IT SEEMED TOO LOVELY A DAY FOR WAR AND BLOODSHED. THE BUGLES PLAYED OCCASIONALLY AS THE MEN HURRIED ALONG BUT NOT A SHOT WAS FIRED. THEY HAD TIME FOR REFLECTION AS THEY MARCHED AND THEY KNEW NOW THEY WERE GOING TO BATTLE. THERE WERE ONLY FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO OF MY LITTLE REGIMENT NOW MARCHING THERE HOPING ALMOST PRAYING THE ENEMY MIGHT ONLY WAIT. HOW LITTLE ANYONE DREAMED THAT BEFORE THE SUN SET TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN OF THAT LITTLE COMMAND WOULD BE STRETCHED DEAD OR DYING AMONG THE AUTUMN LEAVES. IT WAS JUST TWO O'CLOCK WHEN THE REGIMENT RAN ON TO THE ARMY OF THE ENEMY LYING IN LINE RIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD CLOSE TO IUKA. MY OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THE ADVANCE. INSTANTLY IT TOO WAS IN LINE OF BATTLE ACROSS THAT ROAD AND IN A FEW MINUTES ABSOLUTELY THE FIERCEST LITTLE CONFLICT OF THE WAR BEGAN. OUR BRIGADE WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBERED. ROSECRANS HAD TEN THOUSAND SOLDIERS WITHIN FIVE MILES OF THE BATTLEFIELD YET LET THREE OR FOUR SMALL REGIMENTS AND A BATTERY DO ALL THE FIGHTING. TEN MILES AWAY IN ANOTHER DIRECTION LAY GENERAL GRANT AND GENERAL ORD WITH MANY OTHER THOUSANDS AS SILENT AS IF PARALYZED. AN UNLUCKY WIND BLEW THEY SAID AND THE SOUND OF OUR CANNON THAT WAS TO HAVE BEEN THE SIGNAL FOR THEM TO ATTACK ALSO WAS UNHEARD BY THEM. CHARGE AFTER CHARGE WAS MADE UPON OUR LITTLE LINE AND THE ELEVENTH OHIO BATTERY WHICH THE REGIMENT WAS PROTECTING WAS TAKEN AND RETAKEN THREE TIMES. THERE WERE NO BREASTWORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE BRIGADE OF HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED ASSAULT AFTER ASSAULT. IT WAS THE IOWA THE MISSOURI AND THE OHIO BOYS AGAINST THE BOYS OF ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI AND THE GRASS AND LEAVES WERE COVERED WITH THE BODIES IN BLUE AND GRAY. NOT BALAKLAVA NOR THE ALMA SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS A DUEL TO THE DEATH. EVERY HORSE OF THE BATTERY AT THE LEFT OF MY REGIMENT WAS KILLED AND EVERY GUNNER BUT ONE OR TWO WAS SHOT AND LYING AMONG THE DEBRIS. NO BATTERY IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WAR LOST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME. ANTIETAM GETTYSBURG THE WILDERNESS COULD SHOW NOTHING LIKE IT. ONLY THE SETTING SUN PUT AN END TO WHAT WAS PART OF THE TIME A HAND TO HAND CONFLICT. ONE DARING REBEL WAS SHOT DOWN AND BAYONETED CLEAR BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY B WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT. THAT NIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD. WITH A FEW LANTERNS OUR MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE LEFT TILL MORNING. THERE WERE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO UNION MEN LYING THERE IN THEIR BLOOD THAT LONG NIGHT SIX HUNDRED EIGHT OF THEM OUT OF A SINGLE SMALL BRIGADE. WHILE MOTHERS AND SISTERS AT HOME WERE PRAYING FOR THE SAFETY OF THESE DEAR ONES AT THE FRONT THEIR SPIRITS THAT NIGHT WERE LEAVING THEIR TORN BODIES IN THE DARK AND ASCENDING HEAVENWARD. FIVE OF MY EIGHT MESSMATES OF THE DAY BEFORE WERE SHOT. IT WAS NOT A QUESTION WHO WAS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT. FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR LITTLE HALF REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED
