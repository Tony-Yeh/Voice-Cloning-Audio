A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TOO MOWED THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS. EVEN A FOE COULD FEEL PITY TO SEE BRAVE MEN SO CRUELLY SLAUGHTERED. MY CANTEEN WAS FULL OF WATER AND I PRESSED IT TO THE LIPS OF MANY A DYING ENEMY ENEMY NO LONGER. OUR GRAPE SHOT HAD TORN WHOLE COMPANIES OF MEN TO PIECES. THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS. GENERAL ROGERS WHO HAD LED A BRIGADE INTO THE HOPELESS PIT LAY ON HIS BACK DEAD WITH HIS FLAG IN HIS HAND. HE WAS THE FIFTH ONE TO DIE CARRYING THAT FLAG WHEN I REACHED HIM SOME CRUEL ONE HAD STRIPPED HIM OF HIS BOOTS. ANOTHER HAD TAKEN HIS FINE GOLD WATCH. THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AMONG THE UNBURIED DEAD. MANY OF THE WOUNDED EVEN HAD NOT YET BEEN GATHERED UP. OUR REGIMENT NOW PURSUED THE FLYING REBELS WITH GREAT VIGOR. POSSIBLY THE BEST FRIEND I HAD IN THE WORLD SAVE MY KIN WAS KILLED AT THAT BRIDGE. IT WAS LIEUTENANT WILLIAM DODD A CLASSMATE IN SCHOOL. HIS HEAD WAS SHOT OFF BY A CANNONBALL JUST AS HIS REGIMENT WAS CHARGING AT THE BRIDGE. THE PURSUIT OF THE ENEMY WAS BEING PUSHED WITH VIGOR WHEN THE ARMY WAS ORDERED TO DESIST AND RETURN TO CAMP. IT WAS AN ASTOUNDING ORDER AS IT WAS IN OUR POWER TO DESTROY THE DEFEATED AND FLYING COLUMNS. THAT ORDER WAS ONE OF THE MISTAKES OF GRANT'S EARLIER DAYS AS A COMMANDER. INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT IN THOSE DAYS. WE REFLECTED THAT AT SHILOH HE WAS MILES AWAY FROM THE BATTLEFIELD AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT. SHERMAN HAD SAVED THE UNION ARMY FROM DESTRUCTION THERE. AT CORINTH HE WAS FORTY MILES AWAY AND NOW WHEN WE HAD THE ENEMY ALMOST WITHIN OUR GRASP HE SUDDENLY CALLED US BACK. ROSECRANS PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN. THE ORDER MORE IMPERATIVE THAN BEFORE WAS REPEATED. IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME. ROSECRANS IS AT PRESENT THE HERO OF THIS ARMY AND WITH HIM LEADING IT THE BOYS WOULD STORM HADES. WITH THE MERCURY AT ONE HUNDRED THE DUST IN THE ROADS ANKLE DEEP AND THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE YELLOW AND FULL OF IT THE REGIMENTS EXHAUSTED BY THE PURSUIT AND YET DISGUSTED AT OUR RECALL SLOWLY TRAMPED THEIR WAY BACK TO CORINTH. NOW I VISITED MY WOUNDED COMPANIONS IN THE HOSPITAL. ON INQUIRY FOR CERTAIN ONES I LEARNED THAT THEY WERE DEAD AND LYING OUT IN THE IMPROVISED GRAVEYARD NEAR BY. FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHIE BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED. A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR. WE NOW CAMPED ON THE EDGE OF THE TOWN AND WENT ON BUILDING STILL OTHER AND GREATER FORTS. MANY OF THE SOLDIERS MADE HUTS FOR THEMSELVES. IT WAS GETTING COOLER NOW AND LITTLE FIREPLACES WERE BUILT IN THE HUTS AND TENTS. BRICK WAS SCARCE AND IN A FEW INSTANCES THE MEN USED THE STONE SLABS FROM A GRAVEYARD CLOSE AT HAND
