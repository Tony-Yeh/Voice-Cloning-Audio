I KNOCKED AS HARD AS I COULD THE DOOR WAS AT LAST OPENED AND I MADE THE SURGEON FOLLOW ME IN HIS DRESSING GOWN AS FAR AS THE GONDOLA WHICH WAS WAITING HE BLED THE SENATOR WHILE I WAS TEARING MY SHIRT TO MAKE THE COMPRESS AND THE BANDAGE. TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME. THINKING I HAD A RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED. AN HOUR LATER TWO NOBLEMEN FRIENDS OF THE SENATOR CAME IN ONE A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE OTHER. THEY WERE IN DESPAIR THEY HAD ENQUIRED ABOUT THE ACCIDENT FROM THE GONDOLIERS AND HAVING BEEN TOLD THAT I KNEW MORE THAN THEY DID THEY LOADED ME WITH QUESTIONS WHICH I ANSWERED. THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE. ALL VISITORS WERE SENT AWAY BY MY ADVICE AND THE TWO NOBLEMEN AND MYSELF WERE THE ONLY PERSONS IN THE SICK MAN'S ROOM. AT NOON WE PARTOOK SILENTLY OF SOME DINNER WHICH WAS SERVED IN THE SICK ROOM. IN THE EVENING ONE OF THE TWO FRIENDS TOLD ME THAT IF I HAD ANY BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO I COULD GO BECAUSE THEY WOULD BOTH PASS THE NIGHT ON A MATTRESS NEAR THE PATIENT. THIS SENTENTIOUS ANSWER STRUCK THEM WITH ASTONISHMENT AS I EXPECTED IT WOULD AND THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN GREAT SURPRISE. HE WAS CELEBRATED IN VENICE NOT ONLY FOR HIS ELOQUENCE AND HIS GREAT TALENTS AS A STATESMAN BUT ALSO FOR THE GALLANTRIES OF HIS YOUTH. HE HAD BEEN VERY EXTRAVAGANT WITH WOMEN AND MORE THAN ONE OF THEM HAD COMMITTED MANY FOLLIES FOR HIM. HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM. THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERRO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION. THE RAPID EFFECT OF THE REMEDY DELIGHTED THE TWO FRIENDS BUT IT FRIGHTENED ME FOR IN LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE PATIENT WAS LABOURING UNDER GREAT EXCITEMENT OF THE BRAIN. I EXAMINED HIM CLOSELY AND FOUND HIM HARDLY ABLE TO BREATHE. DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN. DOCTOR THE PERSON WHO HAS DELIVERED ME FROM YOUR MERCURY WHICH WAS KILLING ME IS A MORE SKILFUL PHYSICIAN THAN YOU AND SAYING THESE WORDS HE POINTED TO ME. IT WOULD BE HARD TO SAY WHO WAS THE MORE ASTONISHED THE DOCTOR WHEN HE SAW AN UNKNOWN YOUNG MAN WHOM HE MUST HAVE TAKEN FOR AN IMPOSTOR DECLARED MORE LEARNED THAN HIMSELF OR I WHEN I SAW MYSELF TRANSFORMED INTO A PHYSICIAN AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. THEIR INFATUATION ENCOURAGING ME I SPOKE LIKE A LEARNED PHYSICIAN I DOGMATIZED I QUOTED AUTHORS WHOM I HAD NEVER READ. HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH. WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WILL SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES. UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT. THE HERMIT REMARKED THE SENATOR HAS WITHOUT INFORMING YOU OF IT LINKED AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT TO THE CALCULUS HE HAS TAUGHT YOU FOR SIMPLE NUMBERS CAN NOT HAVE THE POWER OF REASON. YOU POSSESS A REAL TREASURE AND YOU MAY DERIVE GREAT ADVANTAGES FROM IT. I OBEYED IMPLICITLY AND MET YOUR EXCELLENCY. THE THREE FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDED. I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
