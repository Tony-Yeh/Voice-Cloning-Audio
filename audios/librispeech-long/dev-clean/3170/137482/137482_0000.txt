WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED. I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY. I KNEW ALL THAT FOR I WAS NOT BLIND TO MY POSITION BUT CONTEMPT THE ONLY THING TO WHICH I COULD NOT HAVE REMAINED INDIFFERENT NEVER SHEWED ITSELF ANYWHERE UNDER A FORM TANGIBLE ENOUGH FOR ME TO HAVE NO DOUBT OF MY BEING DESPISED AND I SET IT AT DEFIANCE BECAUSE I WAS SATISFIED THAT CONTEMPT IS DUE ONLY TO COWARDLY MEAN ACTIONS AND I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN GUILTY OF ANY. I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE. BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL. BY SCRAPING MY VIOLIN I EARNED ENOUGH TO KEEP MYSELF WITHOUT REQUIRING ANYBODY'S ASSISTANCE AND I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE MAN WHO CAN SUPPORT HIMSELF IS HAPPY. WHEN THE PLAY WAS OVER I WENT WITH THEM TO THE DRINKING BOOTH WHICH WE OFTEN LEFT INTOXICATED TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN HOUSES OF ILL FAME. OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER. WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES. WE DID THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCELLENT HEALTH. WE WERE IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING THE WIRES OF THE BELLS IN EVERY HOUSE AND IF WE CHANCED TO FIND A GATE OPEN WE WOULD GO UP THE STAIRS IN THE DARK AND FRIGHTEN THE SLEEPING INMATES BY TELLING THEM VERY LOUDLY THAT THE HOUSE DOOR WAS NOT CLOSED AFTER WHICH WE WOULD GO DOWN MAKING AS MUCH NOISE AS WE COULD AND LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH THE GATE WIDE OPEN. DURING A VERY DARK NIGHT WE FORMED A PLOT TO OVERTURN THE LARGE MARBLE TABLE OF SAINT ANGELO'S SQUARE ON WHICH IT WAS SAID THAT IN THE DAYS OF THE LEAGUE OF CAMBRAY THE COMMISSARIES OF THE REPUBLIC WERE IN THE HABIT OF PAYING THE BOUNTY TO THE RECRUITS WHO ENGAGED TO FIGHT UNDER THE STANDARD OF SAINT MARK A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH SECURED FOR THE TABLE A SORT OF PUBLIC VENERATION. WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS. THE CITY WAS ALIVE WITH COMPLAINTS AND WE LAUGHED AT THE USELESS SEARCH MADE BY THE POLICE TO FIND OUT THOSE WHO DISTURBED THE PEACE OF THE INHABITANTS. WE TOOK GOOD CARE TO BE CAREFUL FOR IF WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED WE STOOD A VERY FAIR CHANCE OF BEING SENT TO PRACTICE ROWING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE COUNCIL OF TEN. BUT AT LAST FEAR PUT A STOP TO OUR CRIMINAL JOKES WHICH IN THOSE DAYS I USED TO CALL ONLY THE FROLICS OF YOUNG MEN
