MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH. TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF. THE YOUNG WOMAN'S HUSBAND WAS A WEAVER BY TRADE AND SO WERE HIS TWO FRIENDS. THEY JOINED TOGETHER TO ADDRESS A COMPLAINT TO THE COUNCIL OF TEN. IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING. SHE HAD INFORMED HIM OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SHE COMPLAINED OF NOTHING BUT OF THE GREAT FRIGHT SHE HAD EXPERIENCED ON ACCOUNT OF HER HUSBAND AND ON THAT COUNT SHE ENTREATED JUSTICE AND THE PUNISHMENT OF THE GUILTY PARTIES. THE DOCUMENT PRODUCED THREE DIFFERENT RESULTS IN THE FIRST PLACE IT AMUSED THE TOWN IN THE SECOND ALL THE IDLERS OF VENICE WENT TO SAINT JOB TO HEAR THE ACCOUNT OF THE ADVENTURE FROM THE LIPS OF THE HEROINE HERSELF AND SHE GOT MANY PRESENTS FROM HER NUMEROUS VISITORS IN THE THIRD PLACE THE COUNCIL OF TEN OFFERED A REWARD OF FIVE HUNDRED DUCATS TO ANY PERSON GIVING SUCH INFORMATION AS WOULD LEAD TO THE ARREST OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE PRACTICAL JOKE EVEN IF THE INFORMER BELONGED TO THE BAND PROVIDED HE WAS NOT THE LEADER. THE OFFER OF THAT REWARD WOULD HAVE MADE US TREMBLE IF OUR LEADER PRECISELY THE ONE WHO ALONE HAD NO INTEREST IN TURNING INFORMER HAD NOT BEEN A PATRICIAN. THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED. THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AFTERWARDS THE CHEVALIER NICOLAS IRON THEN ONE OF THE INQUISITORS ASTONISHED ME GREATLY BY TELLING ME THE WHOLE STORY GIVING THE NAMES OF ALL THE ACTORS. HE DID NOT TELL ME WHETHER ANY ONE OF THE BAND HAD BETRAYED THE SECRET AND I DID NOT CARE TO KNOW BUT I COULD CLEARLY SEE THE CHARACTERISTIC SPIRIT OF THE ARISTOCRACY FOR WHICH THE SOLO MIHI IS THE SUPREME LAW. I PLAYED THE VIOLIN IN ONE OF THE NUMEROUS BANDS ENGAGED FOR THE BALLS WHICH WERE GIVEN FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS IN THE SORANZO PALACE. ON THE THIRD DAY TOWARDS THE END OF THE DANCING AN HOUR BEFORE DAY BREAK FEELING TIRED I LEFT THE ORCHESTRA ABRUPTLY AND AS I WAS GOING DOWN THE STAIRS I OBSERVED A SENATOR WEARING HIS RED ROBES ON THE POINT OF GETTING INTO A GONDOLA. IN TAKING HIS HANDKERCHIEF OUT OF HIS POCKET HE LET A LETTER DROP ON THE GROUND. I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM. HE RECEIVED IT WITH MANY THANKS AND ENQUIRED WHERE I LIVED. I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE. I ACCEPTED GRATEFULLY AND SAT DOWN NEAR HIM. A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE ASKED ME TO RUB HIS LEFT ARM WHICH HE SAID WAS SO BENUMBED THAT HE COULD NOT FEEL IT. I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING. I WAS GREATLY FRIGHTENED I OPENED THE CURTAIN TOOK THE LANTERN AND FOUND HIM ALMOST INSENSIBLE AND THE MOUTH DRAWN ON ONE SIDE. I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS SEIZED WITH AN APOPLECTIC STROKE AND CALLED OUT TO THE GONDOLIERS TO LAND ME AT ONCE IN ORDER TO PROCURE A SURGEON TO BLEED THE PATIENT. I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RAZETTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I ENQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
