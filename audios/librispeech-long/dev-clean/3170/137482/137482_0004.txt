HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER. IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER. I THEREFORE ANSWERED IN ORDINARY FIGURES FOUR LINES OF WHICH HE ALONE COULD BE THE INTERPRETER NOT CARING MUCH AT LEAST IN APPEARANCE HOW THEY WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD. THEY ASKED QUESTIONS ON ALL SORTS OF SUBJECTS AND MY ANSWERS PERFECTLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO MYSELF WERE ALL HELD AS DIVINE BY THEM. THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULUS. NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION. THEY VERY LIKELY THOUGHT THAT IF THEY COULD ATTACH ME TO THEM IT WOULD ANSWER THE PURPOSE AS WELL AS IF THEY POSSESSED THE SCIENCE THEMSELVES. THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE. AFTER THEY HAD ASSURED THEMSELVES OF THE REALITY OF MY CABALISTIC SCIENCE BY QUESTIONS RESPECTING THE PAST THEY DECIDED TO TURN IT TO SOME USE BY CONSULTING IT UPON THE PRESENT AND UPON THE FUTURE. I SAW HOW EASY IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THE ANCIENT HEATHEN PRIESTS TO IMPOSE UPON IGNORANT AND THEREFORE CREDULOUS MANKIND. BUT WHAT I COULD NOT AND PROBABLY NEVER SHALL UNDERSTAND WAS THE REASON FOR WHICH THE FATHERS WHO WERE NOT SO SIMPLE OR SO IGNORANT AS OUR EVANGELISTS DID NOT FEEL ABLE TO DENY THE DIVINITY OF ORACLES AND IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY ASCRIBED THEM TO THE DEVIL. BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT. THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES. THEY WERE NOT MARRIED AND AFTER HAVING RENOUNCED ALL COMMERCE WITH WOMEN THEY HAD BECOME THE ENEMIES OF THE FEMALE SEX PERHAPS A STRONG PROOF OF THE WEAKNESS OF THEIR MINDS. WITH ALL THESE ODDITIES THE THREE FRIENDS WERE TRULY INTELLIGENT AND EVEN WITTY AND AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THEM I COULD NOT RECONCILE THESE ANTAGONISTIC POINTS. BUT A PREJUDICED MIND CANNOT REASON WELL AND THE FACULTY OF REASONING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL. I OFTEN LAUGHED WHEN I HEARD THEM TALK ON RELIGIOUS MATTERS THEY WOULD RIDICULE THOSE WHOSE INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES WERE SO LIMITED THAT THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE MYSTERIES OF RELIGION. THE INCARNATION OF THE WORD THEY WOULD SAY WAS A TRIFLE FOR GOD AND THEREFORE EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND THE RESURRECTION WAS SO COMPREHENSIBLE THAT IT DID NOT APPEAR TO THEM WONDERFUL BECAUSE AS GOD CANNOT DIE JESUS CHRIST WAS NATURALLY CERTAIN TO RISE AGAIN. AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JESUITS. THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF GOING TO CONFESSION EVERY WEEK WITHOUT FEELING THE SLIGHTEST TROUBLE ABOUT THEIR CONFESSORS WHOSE IGNORANCE THEY KINDLY REGRETTED
