WITH THOSE THREE EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTERS WORTHY OF ESTEEM AND RESPECT FOR THEIR MORAL QUALITIES THEIR HONESTY THEIR REPUTATION AND THEIR AGE AS WELL AS FOR THEIR NOBLE BIRTH I SPENT MY DAYS IN A VERY PLEASANT MANNER ALTHOUGH IN THEIR THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE THEY OFTEN KEPT ME HARD AT WORK FOR TEN HOURS RUNNING ALL FOUR OF US BEING LOCKED UP TOGETHER IN A ROOM AND UNAPPROACHABLE TO EVERYBODY EVEN TO FRIENDS OR RELATIVES. I CONFESS CANDIDLY THAT I DECEIVED THEM AS THE PAPA DELDIMOPULO USED TO DECEIVE THE GREEKS WHO APPLIED TO HIM FOR THE ORACLES OF THE VIRGIN. I CERTAINLY DID NOT ACT TOWARDS THEM WITH A TRUE SENSE OF HONESTY BUT IF THE READER TO WHOM I CONFESS MYSELF IS ACQUAINTED WITH THE WORLD AND WITH THE SPIRIT OF SOCIETY I ENTREAT HIM TO THINK BEFORE JUDGING ME AND PERHAPS I MAY MEET WITH SOME INDULGENCE AT HIS HANDS. I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM. THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER CONSIDERATION DEAR READER AND AS I LOVE YOU I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP OF THOSE THREE MEN I WAS CERTAIN OF OBTAINING CONSIDERATION AND INFLUENCE IN MY OWN COUNTRY. BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENON THEY MEET WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND. WHOEVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE. YOUR FIRST PROTECTORS WANTED TO MAKE YOU A PRIEST A DOCTOR AN ADVOCATE A SOLDIER AND ENDED BY MAKING A FIDDLER OF YOU THOSE PERSONS DID NOT KNOW YOU. I KNOW YOU AND APPRECIATE YOU. YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GONDOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQUINS A MONTH. IT IS THE SUM I USED TO RECEIVE FROM MY FATHER WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE. YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVISER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND. I THREW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
