THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS. IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGAZZINO. IT REMAINS OPEN ALL NIGHT AND WINE IS RETAILED THERE AT A CHEAPER PRICE THAN IN ALL THE OTHER DRINKING HOUSES. PEOPLE CAN LIKEWISE EAT IN THE MAGAZZINO BUT THEY MUST OBTAIN WHAT THEY WANT FROM THE PORK BUTCHER NEAR BY WHO HAS THE EXCLUSIVE SALE OF EATABLES AND LIKEWISE KEEPS HIS SHOP OPEN THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. THE NOBILITY THE MERCHANTS EVEN WORKMEN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NEVER SEEN IN THE MAGAZZINO FOR CLEANLINESS IS NOT EXACTLY WORSHIPPED IN SUCH PLACES. YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY. IT WAS DURING THE CARNIVAL OF SEVENTEEN FORTY FIVE AFTER MIDNIGHT WE WERE ALL THE EIGHT OF US RAMBLING ABOUT TOGETHER WITH OUR MASKS ON IN QUEST OF SOME NEW SORT OF MISCHIEF TO AMUSE US AND WE WENT INTO THE MAGAZZINO OF THE PARISH OF THE HOLY CROSS TO GET SOMETHING TO DRINK. WE FOUND THE PUBLIC ROOM EMPTY BUT IN ONE OF THE PRIVATE CHAMBERS WE DISCOVERED THREE MEN QUIETLY CONVERSING WITH A YOUNG AND PRETTY WOMAN AND ENJOYING THEIR WINE. OUR CHIEF A NOBLE VENETIAN BELONGING TO THE BALBI FAMILY SAID TO US IT WOULD BE A GOOD JOKE TO CARRY OFF THOSE THREE BLOCKHEADS AND TO KEEP THE PRETTY WOMAN IN OUR POSSESSION. HE IMMEDIATELY EXPLAINED HIS PLAN AND UNDER COVER OF OUR MASKS WE ENTERED THEIR ROOM BALBI AT THE HEAD OF US. OUR SUDDEN APPEARANCE RATHER SURPRISED THE GOOD PEOPLE BUT YOU MAY FANCY THEIR ASTONISHMENT WHEN THEY HEARD BALBI SAY TO THEM UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH AND BY ORDER OF THE COUNCIL OF TEN I COMMAND YOU TO FOLLOW US IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT MAKING THE SLIGHTEST NOISE AS TO YOU MY GOOD WOMAN YOU NEED NOT BE FRIGHTENED YOU WILL BE ESCORTED TO YOUR HOUSE. WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS SPEECH TWO OF US GOT HOLD OF THE WOMAN TO TAKE HER WHERE OUR CHIEF HAD ARRANGED BEFOREHAND AND THE OTHERS SEIZED THE THREE POOR FELLOWS WHO WERE TREMBLING ALL OVER AND HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF OPPOSING ANY RESISTANCE. THE WAITER OF THE MAGAZZINO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH. WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOAT. NOT ONE OF US KNEW WHERE BALBI WANTED TO TAKE THE THREE POOR DEVILS. HE SAILS ALL ALONG THE CANAL GETS OUT OF IT TAKES SEVERAL TURNINGS AND IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE REACH SAINT GEORGE WHERE BALBI LANDS OUR PRISONERS WHO ARE DELIGHTED TO FIND THEMSELVES AT LIBERTY. AFTER THIS THE BOATMAN IS ORDERED TO TAKE US TO SAINT GENEVIEVE WHERE WE LAND AFTER PAYING FOR THE BOAT. WE PROCEED AT ONCE TO PALOMBO SQUARE WHERE MY BROTHER AND ANOTHER OF OUR BAND WERE WAITING FOR US WITH OUR LOVELY PRISONER WHO WAS CRYING. DO NOT WEEP MY BEAUTY SAYS BALBI TO HER WE WILL NOT HURT YOU WE INTEND ONLY TO TAKE SOME REFRESHMENT AT THE RIALTO AND THEN WE WILL TAKE YOU HOME IN SAFETY. WHERE IS MY HUSBAND. NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW. WE TAKE OFF OUR MASKS AND THE SIGHT OF EIGHT YOUNG HEALTHY FACES SEEMS TO PLEASE THE BEAUTY WE HAD SO UNCEREMONIOUSLY CARRIED OFF. OUR CHIEF AS A MATTER OF RIGHT CLAIMS THE PRIVILEGE OF OPENING THE BALL AND BY DINT OF SWEET WORDS HE OVERCOMES THE VERY NATURAL REPUGNANCE SHE FEELS AT CONSUMMATING THE SACRIFICE IN SO NUMEROUS COMPANY. SHE DOUBTLESS THINKS THE OFFERING AGREEABLE FOR WHEN I PRESENT MYSELF AS THE PRIEST APPOINTED TO SACRIFICE A SECOND TIME TO THE GOD OF LOVE SHE RECEIVES ME ALMOST WITH GRATITUDE AND SHE CANNOT CONCEAL HER JOY WHEN SHE FINDS OUT THAT SHE IS DESTINED TO MAKE US ALL HAPPY
