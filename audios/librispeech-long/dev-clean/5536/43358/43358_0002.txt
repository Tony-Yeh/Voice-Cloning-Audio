WE HAVE STILL TO FACE THE ULTIMATE MIRACLE THE ORIGIN AND PRINCIPLE OF LIFE. HERE IS THE SUPREME MYSTERY THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WORSHIP WITHOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO RELIGION AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MYSTERY OUR ATTITUDE CANNOT BE VERY UNLIKE THAT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WHO BEHOLDS WITH AWE THE DIVINE IN ALL CREATION. IT IS SIMPLE TRUTH THAT THE INDIAN DID NOT SO LONG AS HIS NATIVE PHILOSOPHY HELD SWAY OVER HIS MIND EITHER ENVY OR DESIRE TO IMITATE THE SPLENDID ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE WHITE MAN. IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCORNED THEM EVEN AS A LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBED IN ITS STERN TASK REJECTS THE SOFT BEDS THE LUXURIOUS FOOD THE PLEASURE WORSHIPING DALLIANCE OF A RICH NEIGHBOR. IT WAS CLEAR TO HIM THAT VIRTUE AND HAPPINESS ARE INDEPENDENT OF THESE THINGS IF NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THEM. YET THE RELIGION THAT IS PREACHED IN OUR CHURCHES AND PRACTICED BY OUR CONGREGATIONS WITH ITS ELEMENT OF DISPLAY AND SELF AGGRANDIZEMENT ITS ACTIVE PROSELYTISM AND ITS OPEN CONTEMPT OF ALL RELIGIONS BUT ITS OWN WAS FOR A LONG TIME EXTREMELY REPELLENT. STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM IT IS TRUE THAT THE PROUD PAGAN IN HIS SECRET SOUL DESPISED THE GOOD MEN WHO CAME TO CONVERT AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIM. NOR WERE ITS PUBLICITY AND ITS PHARISEEISM THE ONLY ELEMENTS IN THE ALIEN RELIGION THAT OFFENDED THE RED MAN. TO HIM IT APPEARED SHOCKING AND ALMOST INCREDIBLE THAT THERE WERE AMONG THIS PEOPLE WHO CLAIMED SUPERIORITY MANY IRRELIGIOUS WHO DID NOT EVEN PRETEND TO PROFESS THE NATIONAL FAITH. NOT ONLY DID THEY NOT PROFESS IT BUT THEY STOOPED SO LOW AS TO INSULT THEIR GOD WITH PROFANE AND SACRILEGIOUS SPEECH. MORE THAN THIS EVEN IN THOSE WHITE MEN WHO PROFESSED RELIGION WE FOUND MUCH INCONSISTENCY OF CONDUCT. THEY SPOKE MUCH OF SPIRITUAL THINGS WHILE SEEKING ONLY THE MATERIAL. THEY BOUGHT AND SOLD EVERYTHING TIME LABOR PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE THE LOVE OF WOMAN AND EVEN THE MINISTRATIONS OF THEIR HOLY FAITH. HE MIGHT IN TIME COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE DRUNKARDS AND LICENTIOUS AMONG WHITE MEN WITH WHOM HE TOO FREQUENTLY CAME IN CONTACT WERE CONDEMNED BY THE WHITE MAN'S RELIGION AS WELL AND MUST NOT BE HELD TO DISCREDIT IT. BUT IT WAS NOT SO EASY TO OVERLOOK OR TO EXCUSE NATIONAL BAD FAITH. THE HISTORIANS OF THE WHITE RACE ADMIT THAT THE INDIAN WAS NEVER THE FIRST TO REPUDIATE HIS OATH
