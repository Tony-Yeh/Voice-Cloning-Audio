THUS HE KEPT HIS SPIRIT FREE FROM THE CLOG OF PRIDE CUPIDITY OR ENVY AND CARRIED OUT AS HE BELIEVED THE DIVINE DECREE A MATTER PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT TO HIM. IT WAS NOT THEN WHOLLY FROM IGNORANCE OR IMPROVIDENCE THAT HE FAILED TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT TOWNS AND TO DEVELOP A MATERIAL CIVILIZATION. TO THE UNTUTORED SAGE THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION WAS THE PROLIFIC MOTHER OF ALL EVILS MORAL NO LESS THAN PHYSICAL. HE ARGUED THAT FOOD IS GOOD WHILE SURFEIT KILLS THAT LOVE IS GOOD BUT LUST DESTROYS AND NOT LESS DREADED THAN THE PESTILENCE FOLLOWING UPON CROWDED AND UNSANITARY DWELLINGS WAS THE LOSS OF SPIRITUAL POWER INSEPARABLE FROM TOO CLOSE CONTACT WITH ONE'S FELLOW MEN. ALL WHO HAVE LIVED MUCH OUT OF DOORS KNOW THAT THERE IS A MAGNETIC AND NERVOUS FORCE THAT ACCUMULATES IN SOLITUDE AND THAT IS QUICKLY DISSIPATED BY LIFE IN A CROWD AND EVEN HIS ENEMIES HAVE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT FOR A CERTAIN INNATE POWER AND SELF POISE WHOLLY INDEPENDENT OF CIRCUMSTANCES THE AMERICAN INDIAN IS UNSURPASSED AMONG MEN. THE RED MAN DIVIDED MIND INTO TWO PARTS THE SPIRITUAL MIND AND THE PHYSICAL MIND. THE FIRST IS PURE SPIRIT CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE ESSENCE OF THINGS AND IT WAS THIS HE SOUGHT TO STRENGTHEN BY SPIRITUAL PRAYER DURING WHICH THE BODY IS SUBDUED BY FASTING AND HARDSHIP. IN THIS TYPE OF PRAYER THERE WAS NO BESEECHING OF FAVOR OR HELP. ALL MATTERS OF PERSONAL OR SELFISH CONCERN AS SUCCESS IN HUNTING OR WARFARE RELIEF FROM SICKNESS OR THE SPARING OF A BELOVED LIFE WERE DEFINITELY RELEGATED TO THE PLANE OF THE LOWER OR MATERIAL MIND AND ALL CEREMONIES CHARMS OR INCANTATIONS DESIGNED TO SECURE A BENEFIT OR TO AVERT A DANGER WERE RECOGNIZED AS EMANATING FROM THE PHYSICAL SELF. THE RITES OF THIS PHYSICAL WORSHIP AGAIN WERE WHOLLY SYMBOLIC AND THE INDIAN NO MORE WORSHIPED THE SUN THAN THE CHRISTIAN ADORES THE CROSS. FROM THE SUN AS THE UNIVERSAL FATHER PROCEEDS THE QUICKENING PRINCIPLE IN NATURE AND IN THE PATIENT AND FRUITFUL WOMB OF OUR MOTHER THE EARTH ARE HIDDEN EMBRYOS OF PLANTS AND MEN. THIS IS THE MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL PRAYER. THE ELEMENTS AND MAJESTIC FORCES IN NATURE LIGHTNING WIND WATER FIRE AND FROST WERE REGARDED WITH AWE AS SPIRITUAL POWERS BUT ALWAYS SECONDARY AND INTERMEDIATE IN CHARACTER. WE BELIEVED THAT THE SPIRIT PERVADES ALL CREATION AND THAT EVERY CREATURE POSSESSES A SOUL IN SOME DEGREE THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY A SOUL CONSCIOUS OF ITSELF. THE TREE THE WATERFALL THE GRIZZLY BEAR EACH IS AN EMBODIED FORCE AND AS SUCH AN OBJECT OF REVERENCE. THE INDIAN LOVED TO COME INTO SYMPATHY AND SPIRITUAL COMMUNION WITH HIS BROTHERS OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM WHOSE INARTICULATE SOULS HAD FOR HIM SOMETHING OF THE SINLESS PURITY THAT WE ATTRIBUTE TO THE INNOCENT AND IRRESPONSIBLE CHILD. HE HAD FAITH IN THEIR INSTINCTS AS IN A MYSTERIOUS WISDOM GIVEN FROM ABOVE AND WHILE HE HUMBLY ACCEPTED THE SUPPOSEDLY VOLUNTARY SACRIFICE OF THEIR BODIES TO PRESERVE HIS OWN HE PAID HOMAGE TO THEIR SPIRITS IN PRESCRIBED PRAYERS AND OFFERINGS. WITH HIS LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT HE SAW MIRACLES ON EVERY HAND THE MIRACLE OF LIFE IN SEED AND EGG THE MIRACLE OF DEATH IN LIGHTNING FLASH AND IN THE SWELLING DEEP. NOTHING OF THE MARVELOUS COULD ASTONISH HIM AS THAT A BEAST SHOULD SPEAK OR THE SUN STAND STILL. THE VIRGIN BIRTH WOULD APPEAR SCARCELY MORE MIRACULOUS THAN IS THE BIRTH OF EVERY CHILD THAT COMES INTO THE WORLD OR THE MIRACLE OF THE LOAVES AND FISHES EXCITE MORE WONDER THAN THE HARVEST THAT SPRINGS FROM A SINGLE EAR OF CORN. WHO MAY CONDEMN HIS SUPERSTITION. SURELY NOT THE DEVOUT CATHOLIC OR EVEN PROTESTANT MISSIONARY WHO TEACHES BIBLE MIRACLES AS LITERAL FACT. THE LOGICAL MAN MUST EITHER DENY ALL MIRACLES OR NONE AND OUR AMERICAN INDIAN MYTHS AND HERO STORIES ARE PERHAPS IN THEMSELVES QUITE AS CREDIBLE AS THOSE OF THE HEBREWS OF OLD. IF WE ARE OF THE MODERN TYPE OF MIND THAT SEES IN NATURAL LAW A MAJESTY AND GRANDEUR FAR MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN ANY SOLITARY INFRACTION OF IT COULD POSSIBLY BE LET US NOT FORGET THAT AFTER ALL SCIENCE HAS NOT EXPLAINED EVERYTHING
