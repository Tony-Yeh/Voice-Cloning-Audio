THE SAVAGE PHILOSOPHER THE DUAL MIND. SPIRITUAL GIFTS VERSUS MATERIAL PROGRESS. THE PARADOX OF CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION. THE ORIGINAL ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN TOWARD THE ETERNAL THE GREAT MYSTERY THAT SURROUNDS AND EMBRACES US WAS AS SIMPLE AS IT WAS EXALTED. TO HIM IT WAS THE SUPREME CONCEPTION BRINGING WITH IT THE FULLEST MEASURE OF JOY AND SATISFACTION POSSIBLE IN THIS LIFE. THE WORSHIP OF THE GREAT MYSTERY WAS SILENT SOLITARY FREE FROM ALL SELF SEEKING. IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE ALL SPEECH IS OF NECESSITY FEEBLE AND IMPERFECT THEREFORE THE SOULS OF MY ANCESTORS ASCENDED TO GOD IN WORDLESS ADORATION. NONE MIGHT EXHORT OR CONFESS OR IN ANY WAY MEDDLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER. AMONG US ALL MEN WERE CREATED SONS OF GOD AND STOOD ERECT AS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DIVINITY. OUR FAITH MIGHT NOT BE FORMULATED IN CREEDS NOR FORCED UPON ANY WHO WERE UNWILLING TO RECEIVE IT HENCE THERE WAS NO PREACHING PROSELYTING NOR PERSECUTION NEITHER WERE THERE ANY SCOFFERS OR ATHEISTS. THERE WERE NO TEMPLES OR SHRINES AMONG US SAVE THOSE OF NATURE. BEING A NATURAL MAN THE INDIAN WAS INTENSELY POETICAL. HE WOULD DEEM IT SACRILEGE TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR HIM WHO MAY BE MET FACE TO FACE IN THE MYSTERIOUS SHADOWY AISLES OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST OR ON THE SUNLIT BOSOM OF VIRGIN PRAIRIES UPON DIZZY SPIRES AND PINNACLES OF NAKED ROCK AND YONDER IN THE JEWELED VAULT OF THE NIGHT SKY. HE WHO ENROBES HIMSELF IN FILMY VEILS OF CLOUD THERE ON THE RIM OF THE VISIBLE WORLD WHERE OUR GREAT GRANDFATHER SUN KINDLES HIS EVENING CAMP FIRE HE WHO RIDES UPON THE RIGOROUS WIND OF THE NORTH OR BREATHES FORTH HIS SPIRIT UPON AROMATIC SOUTHERN AIRS WHOSE WAR CANOE IS LAUNCHED UPON MAJESTIC RIVERS AND INLAND SEAS HE NEEDS NO LESSER CATHEDRAL. THAT SOLITARY COMMUNION WITH THE UNSEEN WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE IS PARTLY DESCRIBED IN THE WORD BAMBEDAY LITERALLY MYSTERIOUS FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY TRANSLATED FASTING AND DREAMING. THE FIRST BAMBEDAY OR RELIGIOUS RETREAT MARKED AN EPOCH IN THE LIFE OF THE YOUTH WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF CONFIRMATION OR CONVERSION IN CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE. HAVING FIRST PREPARED HIMSELF BY MEANS OF THE PURIFYING VAPOR BATH AND CAST OFF AS FAR AS POSSIBLE ALL HUMAN OR FLESHLY INFLUENCES THE YOUNG MAN SOUGHT OUT THE NOBLEST HEIGHT THE MOST COMMANDING SUMMIT IN ALL THE SURROUNDING REGION. KNOWING THAT GOD SETS NO VALUE UPON MATERIAL THINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM NO OFFERINGS OR SACRIFICES OTHER THAN SYMBOLIC OBJECTS SUCH AS PAINTS AND TOBACCO. WISHING TO APPEAR BEFORE HIM IN ALL HUMILITY HE WORE NO CLOTHING SAVE HIS MOCCASINS AND BREECH CLOUT. AT THE SOLEMN HOUR OF SUNRISE OR SUNSET HE TOOK UP HIS POSITION OVERLOOKING THE GLORIES OF EARTH AND FACING THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THERE HE REMAINED NAKED ERECT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND FORCES OF HIS ARMING FOR A NIGHT AND A DAY TO TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT RARELY LONGER. SOMETIMES HE WOULD CHANT A HYMN WITHOUT WORDS OR OFFER THE CEREMONIAL FILLED PIPE. IN THIS HOLY TRANCE OR ECSTASY THE INDIAN MYSTIC FOUND HIS HIGHEST HAPPINESS AND THE MOTIVE POWER OF HIS EXISTENCE. WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP HE MUST REMAIN AT A DISTANCE UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN ENTERED THE VAPOR BATH AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS. OF THE VISION OR SIGN VOUCHSAFED TO HIM HE DID NOT SPEAK UNLESS IT HAD INCLUDED SOME COMMISSION WHICH MUST BE PUBLICLY FULFILLED. SOMETIMES AN OLD MAN STANDING UPON THE BRINK OF ETERNITY MIGHT REVEAL TO A CHOSEN FEW THE ORACLE OF HIS LONG PAST YOUTH. THE NATIVE AMERICAN HAS BEEN GENERALLY DESPISED BY HIS WHITE CONQUERORS FOR HIS POVERTY AND SIMPLICITY. FURTHERMORE IT WAS THE RULE OF HIS LIFE TO SHARE THE FRUITS OF HIS SKILL AND SUCCESS WITH HIS LESS FORTUNATE BROTHERS
