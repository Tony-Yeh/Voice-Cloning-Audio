INDIAN NAMES WERE EITHER CHARACTERISTIC NICKNAMES GIVEN IN A PLAYFUL SPIRIT DEED NAMES BIRTH NAMES OR SUCH AS HAVE A RELIGIOUS AND SYMBOLIC MEANING. THIS IS SOMETIMES THE CASE BUT IS NOT THE RULE. A MAN OF FORCIBLE CHARACTER WITH A FINE WAR RECORD USUALLY BEARS THE NAME OF THE BUFFALO OR BEAR LIGHTNING OR SOME DREAD NATURAL FORCE. ANOTHER OF MORE PEACEFUL NATURE MAY BE CALLED SWIFT BIRD OR BLUE SKY. A WOMAN'S NAME USUALLY SUGGESTED SOMETHING ABOUT THE HOME OFTEN WITH THE ADJECTIVE PRETTY OR GOOD AND A FEMININE TERMINATION. NAMES OF ANY DIGNITY OR IMPORTANCE MUST BE CONFERRED BY THE OLD MEN AND ESPECIALLY SO IF THEY HAVE ANY SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE AS SACRED CLOUD MYSTERIOUS NIGHT SPIRIT WOMAN AND THE LIKE. SUCH A NAME WAS SOMETIMES BORNE BY THREE GENERATIONS BUT EACH INDIVIDUAL MUST PROVE THAT HE IS WORTHY OF IT. HIS DAILY DEVOTIONS WERE MORE NECESSARY TO HIM THAN DAILY FOOD. HE WAKES AT DAYBREAK PUTS ON HIS MOCCASINS AND STEPS DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE. HERE HE THROWS HANDFULS OF CLEAR COLD WATER INTO HIS FACE OR PLUNGES IN BODILY. AFTER THE BATH HE STANDS ERECT BEFORE THE ADVANCING DAWN FACING THE SUN AS IT DANCES UPON THE HORIZON AND OFFERS HIS UNSPOKEN ORISON. HIS MATE MAY PRECEDE OR FOLLOW HIM IN HIS DEVOTIONS BUT NEVER ACCOMPANIES HIM. EACH SOUL MUST MEET THE MORNING SUN THE NEW SWEET EARTH AND THE GREAT SILENCE ALONE. WHENEVER IN THE COURSE OF THE DAILY HUNT THE RED HUNTER COMES UPON A SCENE THAT IS STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL OR SUBLIME A BLACK THUNDERCLOUD WITH THE RAINBOW'S GLOWING ARCH ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN A WHITE WATERFALL IN THE HEART OF A GREEN GORGE A VAST PRAIRIE TINGED WITH THE BLOOD RED OF SUNSET HE PAUSES FOR AN INSTANT IN THE ATTITUDE OF WORSHIP. HE SEES NO NEED FOR SETTING APART ONE DAY IN SEVEN AS A HOLY DAY SINCE TO HIM ALL DAYS ARE GOD'S. EVERY ACT OF HIS LIFE IS IN A VERY REAL SENSE A RELIGIOUS ACT. HE RECOGNIZES THE SPIRIT IN ALL CREATION AND BELIEVES THAT HE DRAWS FROM IT SPIRITUAL POWER. HIS RESPECT FOR THE IMMORTAL PART OF THE ANIMAL HIS BROTHER OFTEN LEADS HIM SO FAR AS TO LAY OUT THE BODY OF HIS GAME IN STATE AND DECORATE THE HEAD WITH SYMBOLIC PAINT OR FEATHERS. AS HER HUSBAND RECEIVES THE BOWL OR PLATE HE LIKEWISE MURMURS HIS INVOCATION TO THE SPIRIT. WHEN HE BECOMES AN OLD MAN HE LOVES TO MAKE A NOTABLE EFFORT TO PROVE HIS GRATITUDE. HE CUTS OFF THE CHOICEST MORSEL OF THE MEAT AND CASTS IT INTO THE FIRE THE PUREST AND MOST ETHEREAL ELEMENT. THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WIGWAM IS ONLY LIMITED BY THE INSTITUTION OF WAR. YET IF AN ENEMY SHOULD HONOR US WITH A CALL HIS TRUST WILL NOT BE MISPLACED AND HE WILL GO AWAY CONVINCED THAT HE HAS MET WITH A ROYAL HOST. OUR HONOR IS THE GUARANTEE FOR HIS SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP. FRIENDSHIP IS HELD TO BE THE SEVEREST TEST OF CHARACTER. IT IS EASY WE THINK TO BE LOYAL TO FAMILY AND CLAN WHOSE BLOOD IS IN OUR OWN VEINS. LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS FOUNDED ON THE MATING INSTINCT AND IS NOT FREE FROM DESIRE AND SELF SEEKING. BUT TO HAVE A FRIEND AND TO BE TRUE UNDER ANY AND ALL TRIALS IS THE MARK OF A MAN. THE HIGHEST TYPE OF FRIENDSHIP IS THE RELATION OF BROTHER FRIEND OR LIFE AND DEATH FRIEND. THIS BOND IS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IS USUALLY FORMED IN EARLY YOUTH AND CAN ONLY BE BROKEN BY DEATH
