IF A GIRL SHE IS FROM THIS TIME MUCH UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF HER GRANDMOTHER WHO IS CONSIDERED THE MOST DIGNIFIED PROTECTOR FOR THE MAIDEN. INDEED THE DISTINCTIVE WORK OF BOTH GRANDPARENTS IS THAT OF ACQUAINTING THE YOUTH WITH THE NATIONAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS. THE OLD ARE DEDICATED TO THE SERVICE OF THE YOUNG AS THEIR TEACHERS AND ADVISERS AND THE YOUNG IN TURN REGARD THEM WITH LOVE AND REVERENCE. OUR OLD AGE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS THE HAPPIEST PERIOD OF LIFE ADVANCING YEARS BROUGHT WITH THEM MUCH FREEDOM NOT ONLY FROM THE BURDEN OF LABORIOUS AND DANGEROUS TASKS BUT FROM THOSE RESTRICTIONS OF CUSTOM AND ETIQUETTE WHICH WERE RELIGIOUSLY OBSERVED BY ALL OTHERS. NO ONE WHO IS AT ALL ACQUAINTED WITH THE INDIAN IN HIS HOME CAN DENY THAT WE ARE A POLITE PEOPLE. AS A RULE THE WARRIOR WHO INSPIRED THE GREATEST TERROR IN THE HEARTS OF HIS ENEMIES WAS A MAN OF THE MOST EXEMPLARY GENTLENESS AND ALMOST FEMININE REFINEMENT AMONG HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS. A SOFT LOW VOICE WAS CONSIDERED AN EXCELLENT THING IN MAN AS WELL AS IN WOMAN. INDEED THE ENFORCED INTIMACY OF TENT LIFE WOULD SOON BECOME INTOLERABLE WERE IT NOT FOR THESE INSTINCTIVE RESERVES AND DELICACIES THIS UNFAILING RESPECT FOR THE ESTABLISHED PLACE AND POSSESSIONS OF EVERY OTHER MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CIRCLE THIS HABITUAL QUIET ORDER AND DECORUM. ONLY TO THE AGED WHO HAVE JOURNEYED FAR AND ARE IN A MANNER EXEMPT FROM ORDINARY RULES ARE PERMITTED SOME PLAYFUL FAMILIARITIES WITH CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN SOME PLAIN SPEAKING EVEN TO HARSHNESS AND OBJURGATION FROM WHICH THE OTHERS MUST RIGIDLY REFRAIN. IN SHORT THE OLD MEN AND WOMEN ARE PRIVILEGED TO SAY WHAT THEY PLEASE AND HOW THEY PLEASE WITHOUT CONTRADICTION WHILE THE HARDSHIPS AND BODILY INFIRMITIES THAT OF NECESSITY FALL TO THEIR LOT ARE SOFTENED SO FAR AS MAY BE BY UNIVERSAL CONSIDERATION AND ATTENTION. WE BELIEVED THAT TWO WHO LOVE SHOULD BE UNITED IN SECRET BEFORE THE PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR UNION AND SHOULD TASTE THEIR APOTHEOSIS ALONE WITH NATURE. AN EXCHANGE OF PRESENTS AND ENTERTAINMENTS BETWEEN THE TWO FAMILIES USUALLY FOLLOWED BUT THE NUPTIAL BLESSING WAS GIVEN BY THE HIGH PRIEST OF GOD THE MOST REVEREND AND HOLY NATURE. THE FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UNIT BUT ALSO THE UNIT OF GOVERNMENT. THE CLAN IS NOTHING MORE THAN A LARGER FAMILY WITH ITS PATRIARCHAL CHIEF AS THE NATURAL HEAD AND THE UNION OF SEVERAL CLANS BY INTERMARRIAGE AND VOLUNTARY CONNECTION CONSTITUTES THE TRIBE. THE VERY NAME OF OUR TRIBE DAKOTA MEANS ALLIED PEOPLE. THE REMOTER DEGREES OF KINSHIP WERE FULLY RECOGNIZED AND THAT NOT AS A MATTER OF FORM ONLY FIRST COUSINS WERE KNOWN AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE NAME OF COUSIN CONSTITUTED A BINDING CLAIM AND OUR RIGID MORALITY FORBADE MARRIAGE BETWEEN COUSINS IN ANY KNOWN DEGREE OR IN OTHER WORDS WITHIN THE CLAN. THERE WERE INDEED FEW PLURAL MARRIAGES EXCEPT AMONG THE OLDER AND LEADING MEN AND PLURAL WIVES WERE USUALLY THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY SISTERS. A MARRIAGE MIGHT HONORABLY BE DISSOLVED FOR CAUSE BUT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE INFIDELITY OR IMMORALITY EITHER OPEN OR SECRET. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE POSITION OF WOMAN IS THE TEST OF CIVILIZATION AND THAT OF OUR WOMEN WAS SECURE. IN THEM WAS VESTED OUR STANDARD OF MORALS AND THE PURITY OF OUR BLOOD. THE WIFE DID NOT TAKE THE NAME OF HER HUSBAND NOR ENTER HIS CLAN AND THE CHILDREN BELONGED TO THE CLAN OF THE MOTHER. ALL OF THE FAMILY PROPERTY WAS HELD BY HER DESCENT WAS TRACED IN THE MATERNAL LINE AND THE HONOR OF THE HOUSE WAS IN HER HANDS. MODESTY WAS HER CHIEF ADORNMENT HENCE THE YOUNGER WOMEN WERE USUALLY SILENT AND RETIRING BUT A WOMAN WHO HAD ATTAINED TO RIPENESS OF YEARS AND WISDOM OR WHO HAD DISPLAYED NOTABLE COURAGE IN SOME EMERGENCY WAS SOMETIMES INVITED TO A SEAT IN THE COUNCIL. WHEN SHE FELL THE WHOLE RACE FELL WITH HER. BEFORE THIS CALAMITY CAME UPON US YOU COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE A HAPPIER HOME THAN THAT CREATED BY THE INDIAN WOMAN. HER EARLY AND CONSISTENT TRAINING THE DEFINITENESS OF HER VOCATION AND ABOVE ALL HER PROFOUNDLY RELIGIOUS ATTITUDE GAVE HER A STRENGTH AND POISE THAT COULD NOT BE OVERCOME BY ANY ORDINARY MISFORTUNE
