EARLY RELIGIOUS TEACHING THE FUNCTION OF THE AGED. WOMAN MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY. LOYALTY HOSPITALITY FRIENDSHIP. THE AMERICAN INDIAN WAS AN INDIVIDUALIST IN RELIGION AS IN WAR. HE HAD NEITHER A NATIONAL ARMY NOR AN ORGANIZED CHURCH. THERE WAS NO PRIEST TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANOTHER'S SOUL. THAT IS WE BELIEVED THE SUPREME DUTY OF THE PARENT WHO ONLY WAS PERMITTED TO CLAIM IN SOME DEGREE THE PRIESTLY OFFICE AND FUNCTION SINCE IT IS HIS CREATIVE AND PROTECTING POWER WHICH ALONE APPROACHES THE SOLEMN FUNCTION OF DEITY. THE INDIAN WAS A RELIGIOUS MAN FROM HIS MOTHER'S WOMB. FROM THE MOMENT OF HER RECOGNITION OF THE FACT OF CONCEPTION TO THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR OF LIFE WHICH WAS THE ORDINARY DURATION OF LACTATION IT WAS SUPPOSED BY US THAT THE MOTHER'S SPIRITUAL INFLUENCE COUNTED FOR MOST. HER ATTITUDE AND SECRET MEDITATIONS MUST BE SUCH AS TO INSTILL INTO THE RECEPTIVE SOUL OF THE UNBORN CHILD THE LOVE OF THE GREAT MYSTERY AND A SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD WITH ALL CREATION. SILENCE AND ISOLATION ARE THE RULE OF LIFE FOR THE EXPECTANT MOTHER. SHE WANDERS PRAYERFUL IN THE STILLNESS OF GREAT WOODS OR ON THE BOSOM OF THE UNTRODDEN PRAIRIE AND TO HER POETIC MIND THE IMMANENT BIRTH OF HER CHILD PREFIGURES THE ADVENT OF A MASTER MAN A HERO OR THE MOTHER OF HEROES A THOUGHT CONCEIVED IN THE VIRGIN BREAST OF PRIMEVAL NATURE AND DREAMED OUT IN A HUSH THAT IS ONLY BROKEN BY THE SIGHING OF THE PINE TREE OR THE THRILLING ORCHESTRA OF A DISTANT WATERFALL. AND WHEN THE DAY OF DAYS IN HER LIFE DAWNS THE DAY IN WHICH THERE IS TO BE A NEW LIFE THE MIRACLE OF WHOSE MAKING HAS BEEN INTRUSTED TO HER SHE SEEKS NO HUMAN AID. SHE HAS BEEN TRAINED AND PREPARED IN BODY AND MIND FOR THIS HER HOLIEST DUTY EVER SINCE SHE CAN REMEMBER. THE ORDEAL IS BEST MET ALONE WHERE NO CURIOUS OR PITYING EYES EMBARRASS HER WHERE ALL NATURE SAYS TO HER SPIRIT TIS LOVE TIS LOVE THE FULFILLING OF LIFE. SHE FEELS THE ENDEARING WARMTH OF IT AND HEARS ITS SOFT BREATHING. IT IS STILL A PART OF HERSELF SINCE BOTH ARE NOURISHED BY THE SAME MOUTHFUL AND NO LOOK OF A LOVER COULD BE SWEETER THAN ITS DEEP TRUSTING GAZE. TO HER AND TO THE CHILD THE BIRDS ARE REAL PEOPLE WHO LIVE VERY CLOSE TO THE GREAT MYSTERY THE MURMURING TREES BREATHE HIS PRESENCE THE FALLING WATERS CHANT HIS PRAISE. IF THE CHILD SHOULD CHANCE TO BE FRETFUL THE MOTHER RAISES HER HAND HUSH HUSH SHE CAUTIONS IT TENDERLY THE SPIRITS MAY BE DISTURBED. SHE BIDS IT BE STILL AND LISTEN LISTEN TO THE SILVER VOICE OF THE ASPEN OR THE CLASHING CYMBALS OF THE BIRCH AND AT NIGHT SHE POINTS TO THE HEAVENLY BLAZED TRAIL THROUGH NATURE'S GALAXY OF SPLENDOR TO NATURE'S GOD. SILENCE LOVE REVERENCE THIS IS THE TRINITY OF FIRST LESSONS AND TO THESE SHE LATER ADDS GENEROSITY COURAGE AND CHASTITY. IN THE OLD DAYS OUR MOTHERS WERE SINGLE EYED TO THE TRUST IMPOSED UPON THEM AND AS A NOTED CHIEF OF OUR PEOPLE WAS WONT TO SAY MEN MAY SLAY ONE ANOTHER BUT THEY CAN NEVER OVERCOME THE WOMAN FOR IN THE QUIETUDE OF HER LAP LIES THE CHILD. YOU MAY DESTROY HIM ONCE AND AGAIN BUT HE ISSUES AS OFTEN FROM THAT SAME GENTLE LAP A GIFT OF THE GREAT GOOD TO THE RACE IN WHICH MAN IS ONLY AN ACCOMPLICE. THIS WILD MOTHER HAS NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCE OF HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND THE ACCEPTED RULES OF HER PEOPLE FOR A GUIDE BUT SHE HUMBLY SEEKS TO LEARN A LESSON FROM ANTS BEES SPIDERS BEAVERS AND BADGERS. SHE STUDIES THE FAMILY LIFE OF THE BIRDS SO EXQUISITE IN ITS EMOTIONAL INTENSITY AND ITS PATIENT DEVOTION UNTIL SHE SEEMS TO FEEL THE UNIVERSAL MOTHER HEART BEATING IN HER OWN BREAST. IN DUE TIME THE CHILD TAKES OF HIS OWN ACCORD THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AND SPEAKS REVERENTLY OF THE POWERS. HE THINKS THAT HE IS A BLOOD BROTHER TO ALL LIVING CREATURES AND THE STORM WIND IS TO HIM A MESSENGER OF THE GREAT MYSTERY. AT THE AGE OF ABOUT EIGHT YEARS IF HE IS A BOY SHE TURNS HIM OVER TO HIS FATHER FOR MORE SPARTAN TRAINING
