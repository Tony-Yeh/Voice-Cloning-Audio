THE SCOTCH WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DECLARED THAT SHE HAD THE SECOND SIGHT FOR SHE HAD OTHER REMARKABLE PREMONITIONS OR INTUITIONS WITHIN MY OWN RECOLLECTION. I HAVE HEARD HER SPEAK OF A PECULIAR SENSATION IN THE BREAST BY WHICH AS SHE SAID SHE WAS ADVISED OF ANYTHING OF IMPORTANCE CONCERNING HER ABSENT CHILDREN. OTHER NATIVE WOMEN HAVE CLAIMED A SIMILAR MONITOR BUT I NEVER HEARD OF ONE WHO COULD INTERPRET IT WITH SUCH ACCURACY. ALTHOUGH WE HAD NO OTHER REASON TO DOUBT THE ILL TIDINGS IT IS A FACT THAT MY UNCLE CAME INTO CAMP TWO DAYS AFTER HIS REPORTED DEATH. AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FORT ELLIS ON THE ASSINIBOINE RIVER AND MY YOUNGEST UNCLE HAD SELECTED A FINE SPOT FOR OUR NIGHT CAMP. SO WE RELUCTANTLY WENT ON DOWN THE RIVER AND CAMPED AFTER DARK AT A SECLUDED PLACE. THE NEXT DAY WE LEARNED THAT A FAMILY WHO WERE FOLLOWING CLOSE BEHIND HAD STOPPED AT THE PLACE FIRST SELECTED BY MY UNCLE BUT WERE SURPRISED IN THE NIGHT BY A ROVING WAR PARTY AND MASSACRED TO A MAN. THIS INCIDENT MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION UPON OUR PEOPLE. MANY OF THE INDIANS BELIEVED THAT ONE MAY BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORMER INCARNATION. THERE WERE ALSO THOSE WHO HELD CONVERSE WITH A TWIN SPIRIT WHO HAD BEEN BORN INTO ANOTHER TRIBE OR RACE. THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN SIOUX WAR PROPHET WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MEN OF HIS BAND. AFTER HE HAD REACHED MIDDLE AGE HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD A SPIRIT BROTHER AMONG THE OJIBWAYS THE ANCESTRAL ENEMIES OF THE SIOUX. UPON ONE OF THEIR HUNTS ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN THE TWO TRIBES THE SIOUX LEADER ONE EVENING CALLED HIS WARRIORS TOGETHER AND SOLEMNLY DECLARED TO THEM THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO MEET A LIKE BAND OF OJIBWAY HUNTERS LED BY HIS SPIRIT TWIN. YOU WILL KNOW HIM AT ONCE THE PROPHET SAID TO THEM FOR HE WILL NOT ONLY LOOK LIKE ME IN FACE AND FORM BUT HE WILL DISPLAY THE SAME TOTEM AND EVEN SING MY WAR SONGS. THEY SENT OUT SCOUTS WHO SOON RETURNED WITH NEWS OF THE APPROACHING PARTY
