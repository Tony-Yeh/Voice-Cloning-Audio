IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED OCCULT POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IMPOSTORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL ATTESTED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHECIES AND OTHER MYSTIC PRACTICE. A SIOUX PROPHET PREDICTED THE COMING OF THE WHITE MAN FULLY FIFTY YEARS BEFORE THE EVENT AND EVEN DESCRIBED ACCURATELY HIS GARMENTS AND WEAPONS. BEFORE THE STEAMBOAT WAS INVENTED ANOTHER PROPHET OF OUR RACE DESCRIBED THE FIRE BOAT THAT WOULD SWIM UPON THEIR MIGHTY RIVER THE MISSISSIPPI AND THE DATE OF THIS PROPHECY IS ATTESTED BY THE TERM USED WHICH IS LONG SINCE OBSOLETE. NO DOUBT MANY PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN COLORED TO SUIT THE NEW AGE AND UNQUESTIONABLY FALSE PROPHETS FAKIRS AND CONJURERS HAVE BECOME THE PEST OF THE TRIBES DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD. NEVERTHELESS EVEN DURING THIS PERIOD THERE WAS HERE AND THERE A MAN OF THE OLD TYPE WHO WAS IMPLICITLY BELIEVED IN TO THE LAST. THERE WERE TO BE SEVEN BATTLES ALL SUCCESSFUL EXCEPT THE LAST IN WHICH THE SIOUX WERE TO BE TAKEN AT A DISADVANTAGE AND SUFFER CRUSHING DEFEAT. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER. OUR PEOPLE SURPRISED AND SLEW MANY OF THE OJIBWAYS IN THEIR VILLAGES BUT IN TURN WERE FOLLOWED AND CUNNINGLY LED INTO AN AMBUSH WHENCE BUT FEW CAME OUT ALIVE. THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARKABLE PROPHECIES. ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORN ON THE RUM RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD. HE WAS BORN DURING A DESPERATE BATTLE WITH THE OJIBWAYS AT A MOMENT WHEN AS IT SEEMED THE BAND OF SIOUX ENGAGED WERE TO BE ANNIHILATED. THEREFORE THE CHILD'S GRANDMOTHER EXCLAIMED SINCE WE ARE ALL TO PERISH LET HIM DIE A WARRIOR'S DEATH IN THE FIELD AND SHE PLACED HIS CRADLE UNDER FIRE NEAR THE SPOT WHERE HIS UNCLE AND GRANDFATHERS WERE FIGHTING FOR HE HAD NO FATHER. BUT WHEN AN OLD MAN DISCOVERED THE NEW BORN CHILD HE COMMANDED THE WOMEN TO TAKE CARE OF HIM FOR SAID HE WE KNOW NOT HOW PRECIOUS THE STRENGTH OF EVEN ONE WARRIOR MAY SOME DAY BECOME TO HIS NATION. THIS CHILD LIVED TO BECOME GREAT AMONG US AS WAS INTIMATED TO THE SUPERSTITIOUS BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS BIRTH. AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED HIS BAND FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL ENEMIES BY SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY. FIVE YEARS LATER HE REPEATED THE SERVICE AND AGAIN SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM AWFUL SLAUGHTER. THERE WAS NO CONFUSION OF FIGURES OR OMENS AS WITH LESSER MEDICINE MEN BUT IN EVERY INCIDENT THAT IS TOLD OF HIM HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE SIGN WHATEVER IT WAS PROVED SINGULARLY CORRECT. THE FATHER OF LITTLE CROW THE CHIEF WHO LED THE MINNESOTA MASSACRE OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WAS ANOTHER PROPHET OF SOME NOTE. ONE OF HIS CHARACTERISTIC PROPHECIES WAS MADE ONLY A FEW YEARS BEFORE HE DIED WHEN HE HAD DECLARED THAT ALTHOUGH ALREADY AN OLD MAN HE WOULD GO ONCE MORE UPON THE WAR PATH. THREE OF THE OJIBWAYS WERE INDEED SLAIN AS HE HAD SAID BUT IN THE BATTLE THE OLD WAR PROPHET LOST BOTH OF HIS TWO SONS. THERE ARE MANY TRUSTWORTHY MEN AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH TO VOUCH FOR THESE AND SIMILAR EVENTS OCCURRING AS FORETOLD. I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN THEM BUT I KNOW THAT OUR PEOPLE POSSESSED REMARKABLE POWERS OF CONCENTRATION AND ABSTRACTION AND I SOMETIMES FANCY THAT SUCH NEARNESS TO NATURE AS I HAVE DESCRIBED KEEPS THE SPIRIT SENSITIVE TO IMPRESSIONS NOT COMMONLY FELT AND IN TOUCH WITH THE UNSEEN POWERS. SOME OF US SEEMED TO HAVE A PECULIAR INTUITION FOR THE LOCALITY OF A GRAVE WHICH THEY EXPLAINED BY SAYING THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED A COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPIRIT OF THE DEPARTED. MY OWN GRANDMOTHER WAS ONE OF THESE AND AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER WHEN CAMPING IN A STRANGE COUNTRY MY BROTHER AND I WOULD SEARCH FOR AND FIND HUMAN BONES AT THE SPOT SHE HAD INDICATED TO US AS AN ANCIENT BURIAL PLACE OR THE SPOT WHERE A LONE WARRIOR HAD FALLEN. OF COURSE THE OUTWARD SIGNS OF BURIAL HAD BEEN LONG SINCE OBLITERATED
