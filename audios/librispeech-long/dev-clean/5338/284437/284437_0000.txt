ALL WERE SET UPON NICELY CARVED PINK PEDESTALS. THEY WERE OF COURSE STATUES OF PINKY MEN AND WOMEN AND ALL HAD BANDS OF PINK METAL AROUND THEIR FOREHEADS IN THE CENTER OF EACH BAND BEING A GLISTENING PINK JEWEL. IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE. NO BANNERS FLOATED FROM IT NO FLOWERS GREW NEAR IT. HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF TOURMALINE WHO IS OUR QUEEN. WHAT THAT LITTLE CABIN. EXCLAIMED TROT OF COURSE. DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALACE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED. THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROWD. THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY. COME COMMANDED THE WOMAN WHO LED THE PARTY YOU THREE MUST FOLLOW ME TO THE PRESENCE OF TOURMALINE. THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE. SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS. SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY. HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROT'S SKIN. INSTEAD OF A SILKEN GOWN FURBELOWED LIKE ALL THE OTHERS THEY HAD SEEN WOMEN WEAR IN THIS LAND TOURMALINE WAS DRESSED IN A SEVERELY PLAIN ROBE OF COARSE PINK CLOTH MUCH RESEMBLING BEDTICKING. AS THEY ENTERED THE GIRL SIGHED AND LAID DOWN HER WORK. WHAT IS IT CORALIE SHE ASKED THE WOMAN. THE QUEEN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST. SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE BUTTON BRIGHT'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAP'N BILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE. ARE YOU A GIANT. SHE ASKED THE SAILOR IN A SOFT SWEET VOICE. SHE EXCLAIMED FLUSHING A DEEPER PINK ARE YOU ADDRESSING THAT WORD TO ME. PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDICULE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAILOR'S FACE CLOSELY. THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL. CORALIE DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN. SHE ADDED APPEALING TO THE PINKY WOMAN BY NO MEANS WAS THE PROMPT REPLY. JUST TOURMALINE THAT IS HER NAME AND IT IS SUFFICIENT SAID THE WOMAN. THE RULER OF A COUNTRY OUGHT TO BE TREATED WITH GREAT RESPEC DECLARED TROT A LITTLE INDIGNANTLY FOR SHE THOUGHT THE PRETTY LITTLE QUEEN WAS NOT BEING PROPERLY DEFERRED TO. WHY ASKED TOURMALINE CURIOUSLY. EVEN IN AMERICA EVER'BODY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AN THE BLUESKINS ARE SO FRAID O THEIR BOOLOOROO THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM. BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TOURMALINE GRAVELY. I EVEN DECREE DEATH WHEN SUCH A PUNISHMENT IS MERITED. THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS. IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE. A POWERFUL RULER OUGHT TO BE RICH AND TO LIVE IN A SPLENDID PALACE. YOUR FOLKS OUGHT TO TREAT YOU WITH GREAT RESPECT AS TROT SAYS. OH NO RESPONDED TOURMALINE QUICKLY THAT WOULD INDEED BE VERY WRONG. TOO MUCH SHOULD NEVER BE GIVEN TO ANYONE IF WITH MY GREAT POWER CONFERRED UPON ME BY THE PEOPLE I ALSO POSSESSED GREAT WEALTH I MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO BE CRUEL AND OVERBEARING. IN THAT CASE MY SUBJECTS WOULD JUSTLY GROW ENVIOUS OF MY SUPERIOR STATION. IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINKIES WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE. NO OUR WAY IS BEST
