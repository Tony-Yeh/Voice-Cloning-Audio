IT WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN CAPTAIN WAVERLEY ENTERED THE STRAGGLING VILLAGE OR RATHER HAMLET OF TULLY VEOLAN CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETOR. THE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AN EYE ACCUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF ENGLISH COTTAGES. OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHEN SUCH A CONSUMMATION SEEMED INEVITABLE A WATCHFUL OLD GRANDAM WITH HER CLOSE CAP DISTAFF AND SPINDLE RUSHED LIKE A SIBYL IN FRENZY OUT OF ONE OF THESE MISERABLE CELLS DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND SNATCHING UP HER OWN CHARGE FROM AMONG THE SUNBURNT LOITERERS SALUTED HIM WITH A SOUND CUFF AND TRANSPORTED HIM BACK TO HIS DUNGEON THE LITTLE WHITE HEADED VARLET SCREAMING ALL THE WHILE FROM THE VERY TOP OF HIS LUNGS A SHRILLY TREBLE TO THE GROWLING REMONSTRANCES OF THE ENRAGED MATRON. THE EVIL AND REMEDY SUCH AS IT IS STILL EXIST BUT THIS IS REMOTE FROM OUR PRESENT PURPOSE AND IS ONLY THROWN OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE COLLECTORS UNDER MISTER DENT'S DOG BILL. AS WAVERLEY MOVED ON HERE AND THERE AN OLD MAN BENT AS MUCH BY TOIL AS YEARS HIS EYES BLEARED WITH AGE AND SMOKE TOTTERED TO THE DOOR OF HIS HUT TO GAZE ON THE DRESS OF THE STRANGER AND THE FORM AND MOTIONS OF THE HORSES AND THEN ASSEMBLED WITH HIS NEIGHBOURS IN A LITTLE GROUP AT THE SMITHY TO DISCUSS THE PROBABILITIES OF WHENCE THE STRANGER CAME AND WHERE HE MIGHT BE GOING. THREE OR FOUR VILLAGE GIRLS RETURNING FROM THE WELL OR BROOK WITH PITCHERS AND PAILS UPON THEIR HEADS FORMED MORE PLEASING OBJECTS AND WITH THEIR THIN SHORT GOWNS AND SINGLE PETTICOATS BARE ARMS LEGS AND FEET UNCOVERED HEADS AND BRAIDED HAIR SOMEWHAT RESEMBLED ITALIAN FORMS OF LANDSCAPE. NOR COULD A LOVER OF THE PICTURESQUE HAVE CHALLENGED EITHER THE ELEGANCE OF THEIR COSTUME OR THE SYMMETRY OF THEIR SHAPE ALTHOUGH TO SAY THE TRUTH A MERE ENGLISHMAN IN SEARCH OF THE COMFORTABLE A WORD PECULIAR TO HIS NATIVE TONGUE MIGHT HAVE WISHED THE CLOTHES LESS SCANTY THE FEET AND LEGS SOMEWHAT PROTECTED FROM THE WEATHER THE HEAD AND COMPLEXION SHROUDED FROM THE SUN OR PERHAPS MIGHT EVEN HAVE THOUGHT THE WHOLE PERSON AND DRESS CONSIDERABLY IMPROVED BY A PLENTIFUL APPLICATION OF SPRING WATER WITH A QUANTUM SUFFICIT OF SOAP. THE WHOLE SCENE WAS DEPRESSING FOR IT ARGUED AT THE FIRST GLANCE AT LEAST A STAGNATION OF INDUSTRY AND PERHAPS OF INTELLECT. EVEN CURIOSITY THE BUSIEST PASSION OF THE IDLE SEEMED OF A LISTLESS CAST IN THE VILLAGE OF TULLY VEOLAN THE CURS AFORESAID ALONE SHOWED ANY PART OF ITS ACTIVITY WITH THE VILLAGERS IT WAS PASSIVE. THEY STOOD AND GAZED AT THE HANDSOME YOUNG OFFICER AND HIS ATTENDANT BUT WITHOUT ANY OF THOSE QUICK MOTIONS AND EAGER LOOKS THAT INDICATE THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH THOSE WHO LIVE IN MONOTONOUS EASE AT HOME LOOK OUT FOR AMUSEMENT ABROAD. YET THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXHIBITING THE INDIFFERENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL WHOSE FEATURES AND FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MINERVA. THE CHILDREN ALSO WHOSE SKINS WERE BURNT BLACK AND WHOSE HAIR WAS BLEACHED WHITE BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE SUN HAD A LOOK AND MANNER OF LIFE AND INTEREST. THE BROKEN GROUND ON WHICH THE VILLAGE WAS BUILT HAD NEVER BEEN LEVELLED SO THAT THESE INCLOSURES PRESENTED DECLIVITIES OF EVERY DEGREE HERE RISING LIKE TERRACES THERE SINKING LIKE TAN PITS
