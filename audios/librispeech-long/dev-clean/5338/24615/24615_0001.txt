THE DRY STONE WALLS WHICH FENCED OR SEEMED TO FENCE FOR THEY WERE SORELY BREACHED THESE HANGING GARDENS OF TULLY VEOLAN WERE INTERSECTED BY A NARROW LANE LEADING TO THE COMMON FIELD WHERE THE JOINT LABOUR OF THE VILLAGERS CULTIVATED ALTERNATE RIDGES AND PATCHES OF RYE OATS BARLEY AND PEASE EACH OF SUCH MINUTE EXTENT THAT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THE UNPROFITABLE VARIETY OF THE SURFACE RESEMBLED A TAILOR'S BOOK OF PATTERNS. IN A FEW FAVOURED INSTANCES THERE APPEARED BEHIND THE COTTAGES A MISERABLE WIGWAM COMPILED OF EARTH LOOSE STONES AND TURF WHERE THE WEALTHY MIGHT PERHAPS SHELTER A STARVED COW OR SORELY GALLED HORSE. BUT ALMOST EVERY HUT WAS FENCED IN FRONT BY A HUGE BLACK STACK OF TURF ON ONE SIDE OF THE DOOR WHILE ON THE OTHER THE FAMILY DUNGHILL ASCENDED IN NOBLE EMULATION. THIS AVENUE WAS STRAIGHT AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ROW OF VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESTNUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SYCAMORES WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HEIGHT AND NOURISHED SO LUXURIANTLY THAT THEIR BOUGHS COMPLETELY OVER ARCHED THE BROAD ROAD BENEATH. BEYOND THESE VENERABLE RANKS AND RUNNING PARALLEL TO THEM WERE TWO HIGH WALLS OF APPARENTLY THE LIKE ANTIQUITY OVERGROWN WITH IVY HONEYSUCKLE AND OTHER CLIMBING PLANTS. THIS NETHER PORTAL LIKE THE FORMER OPENED IN FRONT OF A WALL ORNAMENTED WITH SOME RUDE SCULPTURE WITH BATTLEMENTS ON THE TOP OVER WHICH WERE SEEN HALF HIDDEN BY THE TREES OF THE AVENUE THE HIGH STEEP ROOFS AND NARROW GABLES OF THE MANSION WITH LINES INDENTED INTO STEPS AND CORNERS DECORATED WITH SMALL TURRETS ONE OF THE FOLDING LEAVES OF THE LOWER GATE WAS OPEN AND AS THE SUN SHONE FULL INTO THE COURT BEHIND A LONG LINE OF BRILLIANCY WAS FLUNG UPON THE APERTURE UP THE DARK AND GLOOMY AVENUE. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRUGGLING LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOUGHS OF THE SHADY ARCH THAT VAULTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLEY. THE SOLITUDE AND REPOSE OF THE WHOLE SCENE SEEMED ALMOST MONASTIC AND WAVERLEY WHO HAD GIVEN HIS HORSE TO HIS SERVANT ON ENTERING THE FIRST GATE WALKED SLOWLY DOWN THE AVENUE ENJOYING THE GRATEFUL AND COOLING SHADE AND SO MUCH PLEASED WITH THE PLACID IDEAS OF REST AND SECLUSION EXCITED BY THIS CONFINED AND QUIET SCENE THAT HE FORGOT THE MISERY AND DIRT OF THE HAMLET HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM. THE OPENING INTO THE PAVED COURT YARD CORRESPONDED WITH THE REST OF THE SCENE. THE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONSIST OF TWO OR THREE HIGH NARROW AND STEEP ROOFED BUILDINGS PROJECTING FROM EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE INCLOSURE. IT HAD BEEN BUILT AT A PERIOD WHEN CASTLES WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTTISH ARCHITECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ART OF DESIGNING A DOMESTIC RESIDENCE. THE WINDOWS WERE NUMBERLESS BUT VERY SMALL THE ROOF HAD SOME NONDESCRIPT KIND OF PROJECTIONS CALLED BARTIZANS AND DISPLAYED AT EACH FREQUENT ANGLE A SMALL TURRET RATHER RESEMBLING A PEPPER BOX THAN A GOTHIC WATCHTOWER. NEITHER DID THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FROM DANGER. THERE WERE LOOP HOLES FOR MUSKETRY AND IRON STANCHIONS ON THE LOWER WINDOWS PROBABLY TO REPEL ANY ROVING BAND OF GYPSIES OR RESIST A PREDATORY VISIT FROM THE CATERANS OF THE NEIGHBOURING HIGHLANDS. STABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCCUPIED ANOTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE. ABOVE THESE DUNGEON LOOKING STABLES WERE GRANARIES CALLED GIRNELS AND OTHER OFFICES TO WHICH THERE WAS ACCESS BY OUTSIDE STAIRS OF HEAVY MASONRY. TWO BATTLEMENTED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVENUE AND THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDEN COMPLETED THE INCLOSURE. THIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND. THE COURT WAS SPACIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES FOR REMOVING THE LITTER
