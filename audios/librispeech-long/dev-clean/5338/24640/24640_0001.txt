MISTER MORTON THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDUM OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAVERLEY'S INTERVIEW WITH DONALD BEAN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED. EDWARD NOW INQUIRED IF MISTER MORTON KNEW WHAT WAS LIKELY TO BE HIS DESTINATION. STIRLING CASTLE REPLIED HIS FRIEND AND SO FAR I AM WELL PLEASED FOR YOUR SAKE FOR THE GOVERNOR IS A MAN OF HONOUR AND HUMANITY. BUT I AM MORE DOUBTFUL OF YOUR TREATMENT UPON THE ROAD MAJOR MELVILLE IS INVOLUNTARILY OBLIGED TO INTRUST THE CUSTODY OF YOUR PERSON TO ANOTHER. I AM GLAD OF IT ANSWERED WAVERLEY. I DETEST THAT COLD BLOODED CALCULATING SCOTCH MAGISTRATE. I HOPE HE AND I SHALL NEVER MEET MORE. HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR WITH MY WRETCHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INFERENCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE RACKS OF THE INQUISITION. DO NOT VINDICATE HIM MY DEAR SIR FOR THAT I CANNOT BEAR WITH PATIENCE TELL ME RATHER WHO IS TO HAVE THE CHARGE OF SO IMPORTANT A STATE PRISONER AS I AM. I BELIEVE A PERSON CALLED GILFILLAN ONE OF THE SECT WHO ARE TERMED CAMERONIANS. I NEVER HEARD OF THEM BEFORE. THEY CLAIM SAID THE CLERGYMAN TO REPRESENT THE MORE STRICT AND SEVERE PRESBYTERIANS WHO IN CHARLES SECOND'S AND JAMES SECOND'S DAYS REFUSED TO PROFIT BY THE TOLERATION OR INDULGENCE AS IT WAS CALLED WHICH WAS EXTENDED TO OTHERS OF THAT RELIGION. THEY HELD CONVENTICLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE REIGNS. THEY TAKE THEIR NAME FROM THEIR LEADER RICHARD CAMERON. SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH A BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT
