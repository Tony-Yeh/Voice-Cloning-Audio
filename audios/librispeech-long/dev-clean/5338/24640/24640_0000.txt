CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFIDANT. WAVERLEY AWOKE IN THE MORNING FROM TROUBLED DREAMS AND UNREFRESHING SLUMBERS TO A FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE HORRORS OF HIS SITUATION. HOW IT MIGHT TERMINATE HE KNEW NOT. HE MIGHT BE DELIVERED UP TO MILITARY LAW WHICH IN THE MIDST OF CIVIL WAR WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE SCRUPULOUS IN THE CHOICE OF ITS VICTIMS OR THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE. NOR DID HE FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE AT THE THOUGHTS OF A TRIAL BEFORE A SCOTTISH COURT OF JUSTICE WHERE HE KNEW THE LAWS AND FORMS DIFFERED IN MANY RESPECTS FROM THOSE OF ENGLAND AND HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO BELIEVE HOWEVER ERRONEOUSLY THAT THE LIBERTY AND RIGHTS OF THE SUBJECT WERE LESS CAREFULLY PROTECTED. A SENTIMENT OF BITTERNESS ROSE IN HIS MIND AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WHICH HE CONSIDERED AS THE CAUSE OF HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND PERIL AND HE CURSED INTERNALLY HIS SCRUPULOUS REJECTION OF MAC IVOR'S INVITATION TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE FIELD. HOW TRUE HAS YOUR PROPHECY PROVED AND HOW SPEEDY HOW VERY SPEEDY HAS BEEN ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT. WHILE EDWARD WAS RUMINATING ON THESE PAINFUL SUBJECTS OF CONTEMPLATION AND VERY NATURALLY THOUGH NOT QUITE SO JUSTLY BESTOWING UPON THE REIGNING DYNASTY THAT BLAME WHICH WAS DUE TO CHANCE OR IN PART AT LEAST TO HIS OWN UNREFLECTING CONDUCT MISTER MORTON AVAILED HIMSELF OF MAJOR MELVILLE'S PERMISSION TO PAY HIM AN EARLY VISIT. WAVERLEY'S FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO INTIMATE A DESIRE THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE DISTURBED WITH QUESTIONS OR CONVERSATION BUT HE SUPPRESSED IT UPON OBSERVING THE BENEVOLENT AND REVEREND APPEARANCE OF THE CLERGYMAN WHO HAD RESCUED HIM FROM THE IMMEDIATE VIOLENCE OF THE VILLAGERS. MISTER MORTON REPLIED THAT FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT. HE PAUSED AND THEN PROCEEDED I DO NOT INTRUDE MYSELF ON YOUR CONFIDENCE MISTER WAVERLEY FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEARNING ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH CAN BE PREJUDICIAL EITHER TO YOURSELF OR TO OTHERS BUT I OWN MY EARNEST WISH IS THAT YOU WOULD INTRUST ME WITH ANY PARTICULARS WHICH COULD LEAD TO YOUR EXCULPATION. YOU ARE SIR I PRESUME A PRESBYTERIAN CLERGYMAN MISTER MORTON BOWED. EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MORTON OR WHO HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE GAGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTUE. I KNOW INDEED THAT I AM INNOCENT BUT I HARDLY SEE HOW I CAN HOPE TO PROVE MYSELF SO. IT IS FOR THAT VERY REASON MISTER WAVERLEY SAID THE CLERGYMAN THAT I VENTURE TO SOLICIT YOUR CONFIDENCE. MY KNOWLEDGE OF INDIVIDUALS IN THIS COUNTRY IS PRETTY GENERAL AND CAN UPON OCCASION BE EXTENDED. WAVERLEY AFTER A FEW MINUTES REFLECTION WAS CONVINCED THAT HIS REPOSING CONFIDENCE IN MISTER MORTON SO FAR AS HE HIMSELF WAS CONCERNED COULD HURT NEITHER MISTER BRADWARDINE NOR FERGUS MAC IVOR BOTH OF WHOM HAD OPENLY ASSUMED ARMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT IT MIGHT POSSIBLY IF THE PROFESSIONS OF HIS NEW FRIEND CORRESPONDED IN SINCERITY WITH THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS EXPRESSION BE OF SOME SERVICE TO HIMSELF. MISTER MORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAVERLEY'S VISIT TO DONALD BEAN LEAN. I AM GLAD HE SAID YOU DID NOT MENTION THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE MAJOR. IT IS CAPABLE OF GREAT MISCONSTRUCTION ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO DO NOT CONSIDER THE POWER OF CURIOSITY AND THE INFLUENCE OF ROMANCE AS MOTIVES OF YOUTHFUL CONDUCT. WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLEY ANY SUCH HAIR BRAINED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD INEXPRESSIBLE CHARMS FOR ME. HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE RUDE SPHERE IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCUMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS
