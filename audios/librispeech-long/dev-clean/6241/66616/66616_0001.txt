AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS. FOR A TIME THE OUTLAWS WERE DRIVEN FROM THE COUNTRY BUT THE BLOODTHIRSTY CHIEF HIMSELF COULD NOT BE CAPTURED. HE LOVED THE WILDS WITH THE PASSION OF HIS MOTHER'S RACE. HIS NATURE REVOLTED AT THE THOUGHTS OF A GREAT CITY WITH ITS CROWDED STREETS ITS NOISE AND BUSTLE AND DIRT. IT WAS THEN THAT MINNETAKI PLEADED WITH HIM BEGGED HIM TO GO FOR JUST ONE YEAR AND TO COME BACK AND TELL HER OF ALL HE HAD SEEN AND TEACH HER WHAT HE HAD LEARNED. FOR THREE MONTHS WABI DEVOTED HIMSELF FAITHFULLY TO HIS STUDIES IN DETROIT. BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNETAKI AND HIS FORESTS. THE PASSING OF EACH DAY BECAME A PAINFUL TASK TO HIM. HIS FATHER HAD DIED BEFORE HE COULD REMEMBER AND THE PROPERTY HE HAD LEFT HAD DWINDLED SLOWLY AWAY DURING THE PASSING OF YEARS. ROD WAS SPENDING HIS LAST WEEK IN SCHOOL WHEN HE MET WABIGOON. NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK. AS THE BOY DESCRIBED THE SITUATION TO HIS INDIAN FRIEND HIS MOTHER HAD FOUGHT TO THE LAST DITCH TO KEEP HIM IN SCHOOL BUT NOW HIS TIME WAS UP. WABI SEIZED UPON THE WHITE YOUTH AS AN OASIS IN A VAST DESERT. AFTER A LITTLE THE TWO BECAME ALMOST INSEPARABLE AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP CULMINATED IN WABI'S GOING TO LIVE IN THE DREW HOME. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THE RAGGED EDGES WERE SMOOTHED AWAY FROM THE INDIAN BOY'S DEPORTMENT AND HIS LETTERS TO MINNETAKI WERE MORE AND MORE FILLED WITH ENTHUSIASTIC DESCRIPTIONS OF HIS NEW FRIENDS. THERE WERE NOW FEW LONELY HOURS FOR THE TWO BOYS. DURING THE LONG WINTER EVENINGS WHEN RODERICK WAS THROUGH WITH HIS DAY'S WORK AND WABI HAD COMPLETED HIS STUDIES THEY WOULD SIT BEFORE THE FIRE AND THE INDIAN YOUTH WOULD DESCRIBE THE GLORIOUS LIFE OF THE VAST NORTHERN WILDERNESS AND DAY BY DAY AND WEEK BY WEEK THERE STEADILY DEVELOPED WITHIN ROD'S BREAST A DESIRE TO SEE AND LIVE THAT LIFE. A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM. BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WABI WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINNETAKI AND TO HIS FORESTS. THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOYS EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE. MANY OF THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PAINFUL TO RODERICK DREW. EIGHT MONTHS HAD BRED A NEW NATURE IN HIM AND WHEN WABI LEFT IT WAS AS IF A PART OF HIS OWN LIFE HAD GONE WITH HIM. SPRING CAME AND PASSED AND THEN SUMMER. THEN IN THE EARLY AUTUMN WHEN SEPTEMBER FROSTS WERE TURNING THE LEAVES OF THE NORTH TO RED AND GOLD THERE CAME THE LONG LETTER FROM WABI WHICH BROUGHT JOY EXCITEMENT AND MISGIVING INTO THE LITTLE HOME OF THE MOTHER AND HER SON. WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN IN DETROIT IN THREE YEARS. WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKEN. TWO WINTERS AGO I KILLED FORTY AND I DID NOT MAKE A BUSINESS OF IT AT THAT. DON'T BOTHER ABOUT A GUN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE HAVE EVERYTHING HERE. FOR SEVERAL DAYS MISSUS DREW AND HER SON DELIBERATED UPON THE SITUATION BEFORE A REPLY WAS SENT TO THE NEWSOMES. RODERICK PLEADED PICTURED THE GLORIOUS TIMES THEY WOULD HAVE THE HEALTH THAT IT WOULD GIVE THEM AND MARSHALED IN A DOZEN DIFFERENT WAYS HIS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF ACCEPTING THE INVITATION. ON THE OTHER HAND HIS MOTHER WAS FILLED WITH DOUBT. THEIR FINANCES WERE ALARMINGLY LOW AND ROD WOULD BE GIVING UP A SURE THOUGH SMALL INCOME WHICH WAS NOW SUPPORTING THEM COMFORTABLY. HIS FUTURE WAS BRIGHT AND THAT WINTER WOULD SEE HIM PROMOTED TO TEN DOLLARS A WEEK IN THE MERCANTILE HOUSE WHERE HE WAS EMPLOYED. IN THE END THEY CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING. THREE WEEKS LATER CAME WABIGOON'S REPLY. ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET ROD AT SPRUCEWOOD ON THE BLACK STURGEON RIVER. THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF WABI'S LETTER FOUND ROD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
