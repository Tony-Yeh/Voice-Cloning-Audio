HAD THE YOUNG HUNTERS THE POWER OF LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE THEIR CAMP FIRE THAT NIGHT ON THE FROZEN OMBABIKA MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEIR LAST AND A FEW DAYS LATER WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM BACK ON THE EDGES OF CIVILIZATION. BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED. FATE HAD PLAYED A HARD GAME WITH YOUNG NEWSOME HAD FIRST ROBBED HIM OF BOTH PARENTS AND THEN IN A SINGLE FITFUL TURN OF HER WHEEL DEPRIVED HIM OF WHAT LITTLE PROPERTY HE HAD INHERITED. MINNETAKI WAS JUST BUDDING INTO THE EARLY WOMANHOOD OF HER RACE AND POSSESSED A BEAUTY SELDOM SEEN AMONG INDIAN MAIDENS. THEREAFTER HIS VISITS TO WABIGOON'S VILLAGE THIRTY MILES DEEPER IN THE WILDERNESS WERE OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE. FROM THE BEGINNING MINNETAKI RETURNED THE YOUNG FACTOR'S AFFECTIONS BUT A MOST POTENT REASON PREVENTED THEIR MARRIAGE. FOR A LONG TIME MINNETAKI HAD BEEN ARDENTLY WOOED BY A POWERFUL YOUNG CHIEF NAMED WOONGA WHOM SHE CORDIALLY DETESTED BUT UPON WHOSE FAVOR AND FRIENDSHIP DEPENDED THE EXISTENCE OF HER FATHER'S SWAY OVER HIS HUNTING GROUNDS. MINNETAKI HERSELF REPLIED TO THIS ULTIMATUM. IT WAS A REPLY THAT STIRRED THE FIRES OF HATRED AND REVENGE TO FEVER HEAT IN WOONGA'S BREAST. ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WABIGOON'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS. WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED. A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOONGA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS. THREE DAYS LATER MINNETAKI BECAME NEWSOME'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST. FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FEUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEUD WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION. HUNTERS FROM WABINOSH HOUSE WERE AMBUSHED AND SLAIN. INDIANS WHO CAME TO THE POST TO TRADE WERE REGARDED AS ENEMIES AND THE PASSING OF YEARS SEEMED TO MAKE BUT LITTLE DIFFERENCE THE FEUD STILL EXISTED. THE OUTLAWS CAME TO BE SPOKEN OF AS WOONGAS AND A WOONGA WAS REGARDED AS A FAIR TARGET FOR ANY MAN'S RIFLE. MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEWSOME AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE. ONE OF THESE THE ELDEST WAS A BOY AND IN HONOR OF THE OLD CHIEF HE WAS NAMED WABIGOON AND CALLED WABI FOR SHORT. THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NEWSOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINNETAKI. CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABI RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETAKI AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD. WABI ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINEWY AS AGILE AS A LYNX AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD. YET BORN IN HIM WAS A CAUCASIAN SHREWDNESS AND INTELLIGENCE THAT REACHED BEYOND THE FACTOR HIMSELF. ONE OF NEWSOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINNETAKI AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN. CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR'S SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN PORT ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS. THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPILS AND BY THE TIME WABI WAS SIXTEEN AND MINNETAKI TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS. IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOONGAS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS. THESE OUTLAWS NO LONGER PRETENDED TO EARN THEIR LIVELIHOOD BY HONEST MEANS BUT PREYED UPON TRAPPERS AND OTHER INDIANS WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION ROBBING AND KILLING WHENEVER SAFE OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED THEMSELVES. THE HATRED FOR THE PEOPLE OF WABINOSH HOUSE BECAME HEREDITARY AND THE WOONGA CHILDREN GREW UP WITH IT IN THEIR HEARTS. THE REAL CAUSE OF THE FEUD HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN BY MANY THOUGH NOT BY WOONGA HIMSELF
