OUT OF THREE ROOMS OF WHICH HIS HOUSE WAS COMPOSED TWO WERE PLACED AT OUR SERVICE AND IN A FEW HOURS WE WERE INSTALLED WITH ALL OUR BAGGAGE THE AMOUNT OF WHICH RATHER ASTONISHED THE SIMPLE INHABITANTS OF REYKJAVIK. NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS AN GOES WELL THE WORSE DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER. HOW THE WORSE DIFFICULTY OVER I CRIED IN FRESH AMAZEMENT DOUBTLESS. NOTHING MORE REMAINS BUT TO DESCEND INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH. WELL SIR TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOU ARE RIGHT. WE HAVE ONLY TO GO DOWN BUT AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION. I WANT TO KNOW HOW WE ARE TO GET UP AGAIN. THAT IS THE LEAST PART OF THE BUSINESS AND DOES NOT IN ANY WAY TROUBLE ME. IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE. I AM ABOUT TO VISIT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY. VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SAKNUSSEMM. I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSULT THEM. IN THE MEANWHILE I REPLIED I WILL TAKE A WALK THROUGH THE TOWN. WILL YOU NOT LIKEWISE DO SO. I FEEL NO INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT SAID MY UNCLE. I BOWED BY WAY OF REPLY PUT ON MY HAT AND FURRED CLOAK AND WENT OUT. THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY. THE LONGEST OF THE STREETS OF REYKJAVIK RUNS PARALLEL TO THE SHORE. THE OTHER STREET SITUATED MORE TO THE WEST RUNS TOWARD A LITTLE LAKE BETWEEN THE RESIDENCES OF THE BISHOP AND THE OTHER PERSONAGES NOT ENGAGED IN COMMERCE. I HAD SOON SEEN ALL I WANTED OF THESE WEARY AND DISMAL THOROUGHFARES. HERE AND THERE WAS A STRIP OF DISCOLORED TURF LIKE AN OLD WORN OUT BIT OF WOOLEN CARPET AND NOW AND THEN A BIT OF KITCHEN GARDEN IN WHICH GREW POTATOES CABBAGE AND LETTUCE ALMOST DIMINUTIVE ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THE IDEA OF LILLIPUT. IN THE CENTRE OF THE NEW COMMERCIAL STREET I FOUND THE PUBLIC CEMETERY ENCLOSED BY AN EARTHEN WALL. THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR CENTURIES. FROM HENCE I WENT TO THE HOUSE OF THE GOVERNOR A MERE HUT IN COMPARISON WITH THE MANSION HOUSE OF HAMBURG BUT A PALACE ALONGSIDE THE OTHER ICELANDIC HOUSES. BETWEEN THE LITTLE LAKE AND THE TOWN WAS THE CHURCH BUILT IN SIMPLE PROTESTANT STYLE AND COMPOSED OF CALCINED STONES THROWN UP BY VOLCANIC ACTION. I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PASTOR AND CONGREGATION. UPON AN EMINENCE CLOSE AT HAND WAS THE NATIONAL SCHOOL IN WHICH WERE TAUGHT HEBREW ENGLISH FRENCH AND DANISH. IN THREE HOURS MY TOUR WAS COMPLETE. THE GENERAL IMPRESSION UPON MY MIND WAS SADNESS. NO TREES NO VEGETATION SO TO SPEAK ON ALL SIDES VOLCANIC PEAKS THE HUTS OF TURF AND EARTH MORE LIKE ROOFS THAN HOUSES. THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS ON THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY. I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION. THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MIEN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE LADDER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESKIMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR CIRCLE. SOMETIMES THEY GAVE VENT TO A CONVULSIVE LAUGH BUT BY NO CHANCE DID THEY SMILE
