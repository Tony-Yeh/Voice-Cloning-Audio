THE HOUR OF DEPARTURE CAME AT LAST. IN RETURN MY UNCLE NEARLY CRUSHED HIS HANDS SO WARMLY DID HE SHAKE THEM. ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP VALKYRIE. BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFER. WELL AND HAVE WE A FAIR WIND. A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS THE SCHOONER STARTED BEFORE THE WIND UNDER ALL THE CANVAS SHE COULD CARRY AND ENTERED THE CHANNEL. MY UNCLE WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAMLET. SUBLIME MADMAN THOUGHT I YOU DOUBTLESS WOULD APPROVE OUR PROCEEDINGS. YOU MIGHT PERHAPS EVEN FOLLOW US TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH THERE TO RESOLVE YOUR ETERNAL DOUBTS. BUT NO GHOST OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS. THE FACT IS THE CASTLE IS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DENMARK. IT IS NOW THE RESIDENCE OF THE KEEPER OF THE STRAIT OF THE SOUND AND THROUGH THAT SOUND MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND VESSELS OF ALL NATIONS PASS EVERY YEAR. AND HERE THE SCHOONER BEGAN TO FEEL IN EARNEST THE BREEZES OF THE KATTEGAT. THE VALKYRIE WAS SWIFT ENOUGH BUT WITH ALL SAILING BOATS THERE IS THE SAME UNCERTAINTY. HER CARGO WAS COAL FURNITURE POTTERY WOOLEN CLOTHING AND A LOAD OF CORN. HOW LONG WILL THE VOYAGE LAST ASKED MY UNCLE. AT ALL EVENTS THERE WILL BE NO VERY CONSIDERABLE DELAY CRIED THE IMPATIENT PROFESSOR. NO MISTER HARDWIGG SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT. AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME DAY. OUR VESSEL NOW FELT THE FULL FORCE OF THE OCEAN WAVES AND THE WIND SHIFTING WE WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY MADE THE FAROE ISLES. THE VOYAGE OFFERED NO INCIDENT WORTHY OF RECORD. I BORE IT VERY WELL BUT MY UNCLE TO HIS GREAT ANNOYANCE AND EVEN SHAME WAS REMARKABLY SEASICK. ALL THESE EXPLANATIONS HE HAD TO ADJOURN TO THE PERIOD OF HIS ARRIVAL. ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNT MYRDALS YOKUL WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY. THE CAPE ITSELF IS NOTHING BUT A HUGE MOUNT OF GRANITE STANDING NAKED AND ALONE TO MEET THE ATLANTIC WAVES. THE VALKYRIE KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD. ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WHALES AND SHARKS. MY UNCLE TO HIS GREAT DISGUST WAS UNABLE EVEN TO CRAWL ON DECK SO HEAVY A SEA WAS ON AND THUS LOST THE FIRST VIEW OF THE LAND OF PROMISE. NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAND. THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIODICAL VESSEL. PROFESSOR HARDWIGG WAS IN HASTE TO LEAVE HIS PRISON OR RATHER AS HE CALLED IT HIS HOSPITAL BUT BEFORE HE ATTEMPTED TO DO SO HE CAUGHT HOLD OF MY HAND LED ME TO THE QUARTERDECK OF THE SCHOONER TOOK MY ARM WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND POINTED INLAND WITH HIS RIGHT OVER THE NORTHERN PART OF THE BAY TO WHERE ROSE A HIGH TWO PEAKED MOUNTAIN A DOUBLE CONE COVERED WITH ETERNAL SNOW. BEHOLD HE WHISPERED IN AN AWE STRICKEN VOICE BEHOLD MOUNT SNEFFELS. THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US. SCARCELY WERE WE FAIRLY ON SHORE WHEN THERE APPEARED BEFORE US A MAN OF EXCELLENT APPEARANCE WEARING THE COSTUME OF A MILITARY OFFICER. HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BARON TRAMPE. THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH. HE THEREFORE HANDED HIM THE LETTERS FROM COPENHAGEN AND A BRIEF CONVERSATION IN DANISH FOLLOWED TO WHICH I OF COURSE WAS A STRANGER AND FOR A VERY GOOD REASON FOR I DID NOT KNOW THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH THEY CONVERSED. WE WERE THEREFORE COMPELLED TO DEFER THE PLEASURE OF BEING PRESENTED TO HIM. THIS MODEST SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDIC AND LATIN. WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
