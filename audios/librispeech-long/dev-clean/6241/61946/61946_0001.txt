HANS STOPPED HERE ONE HALF HOUR. HE SHARED OUR FRUGAL BREAKFAST ANSWERED YES AND NO TO MY UNCLE'S QUESTIONS AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ROAD AND AT LAST WHEN ASKED WHERE WE WERE TO PASS THE NIGHT WAS AS LACONIC AS USUAL. GARDAR WAS HIS ONE WORDED REPLY. I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDAR WAS TO BE FOUND. THREE HOURS LATER STILL TRAVELING OVER THOSE APPARENTLY INTERMINABLE AND SANDY PRAIRIES WE WERE COMPELLED TO GO ROUND THE KOLLAFJORD AN EASIER AND SHORTER CUT THAN CROSSING THE GULFS. THESE SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM. THE FJORD WAS IN THIS PLACE ABOUT HALF A MILE IN WIDTH. THE SWEEPING AND BROKEN WAVES CAME ROLLING IN UPON THE POINTED ROCKS THE GULF WAS SURROUNDED BY ROCKY WALLS A MIGHTY CLIFF THREE THOUSAND FEET IN HEIGHT REMARKABLE FOR ITS BROWN STRATA SEPARATED HERE AND THERE BY BEDS OF TUFA OF A REDDISH HUE. NOW WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE INTELLIGENCE OF OUR HORSES I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST RELIANCE UPON THEM AS A MEANS OF CROSSING A STORMY ARM OF THE SEA. TO RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD. IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN THEIRS. BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOR TO WAIT. HE DUG HIS HEELS INTO THE SIDES OF HIS STEED AND MADE FOR THE SHORE. AT LENGTH THE STURDY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES. WRETCHED ANIMAL CRIED MY UNCLE SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED INTO A FOOT PASSENGER AND AS ANGRY AND ASHAMED AS A DISMOUNTED CAVALRY OFFICER ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE. FARJA SAID THE GUIDE TAPPING HIM FAMILIARLY ON THE SHOULDER WHAT A FERRY BOAT. DER ANSWERED HANS POINTING TO WHERE LAY THE BOAT IN QUESTION THERE. WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE CRIED MY UNCLE WHY NOT START AT ONCE TIDVATTEN SAID THE GUIDE. WHAT DOES HE SAY I ASKED CONSIDERABLY PUZZLED BY THE DELAY AND THE DIALOGUE. HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION. OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND WE MUST WAIT TILL THE TIDE SERVES. MY UNCLE FROWNED STAMPED HIS FEET AND THEN FOLLOWED THE HORSES TO WHERE THE BOAT LAY. I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FJORD FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER. ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FERRY BOATS OF THE ELBE I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
