THE WEATHER WAS OVERCAST BUT SETTLED WHEN WE COMMENCED OUR ADVENTUROUS AND PERILOUS JOURNEY. WE HAD NEITHER TO FEAR FATIGUING HEAT NOR DRENCHING RAIN. IT WAS IN FACT REAL TOURIST WEATHER. AS THERE WAS NOTHING I LIKED BETTER THAN HORSE EXERCISE THE PLEASURE OF RIDING THROUGH AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY CAUSED THE EARLY PART OF OUR ENTERPRISE TO BE PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE TO ME. I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY. ALL THEN THAT MAY BE REQUIRED OF ME I WILL DO CHEERFULLY AND WILL CREATE NO DIFFICULTY. IT WAS JUST BEFORE WE LEFT REYKJAVIK THAT I CAME TO THIS DECISION. HANS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP. OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WHIP OR SPUR. MY UNCLE AND I CAME BEHIND CUTTING A VERY TOLERABLE FIGURE UPON OUR SMALL BUT VIGOROUS ANIMALS. ICELAND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST ISLANDS IN EUROPE. IT CONTAINS THIRTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF SURFACE AND HAS ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND INHABITANTS. GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTHWEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VERNACULAR IS CALLED SUDVESTR FJORDUNGR. HANS ON TAKING HIS DEPARTURE FROM REYKJAVIK HAD FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE SEA. WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARSE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN. THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW. THE RUGGED SUMMITS OF THE ROCKY HILLS WERE DIMLY VISIBLE ON THE EDGE OF THE HORIZON THROUGH THE MISTY FOGS EVERY NOW AND THEN SOME HEAVY FLAKES OF SNOW SHOWED CONSPICUOUS IN THE MORNING LIGHT WHILE CERTAIN LOFTY AND POINTED ROCKS WERE FIRST LOST IN THE GREY LOW CLOUDS THEIR SUMMITS CLEARLY VISIBLE ABOVE LIKE JAGGED REEFS RISING FROM A TROUBLOUS SEA. EVERY NOW AND THEN A SPUR OF ROCK CAME DOWN THROUGH THE ARID GROUND LEAVING US SCARCELY ROOM TO PASS. MY UNCLE HAD NOT EVEN THE SATISFACTION OF URGING FORWARD HIS STEED BY WHIP SPUR OR VOICE. IT WAS UTTERLY USELESS TO SHOW ANY SIGNS OF IMPATIENCE. I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED CENTAUR. GOOD BEAST GOOD BEAST HE WOULD CRY. I ASSURE YOU THAT I BEGIN TO THINK NO ANIMAL IS MORE INTELLIGENT THAN AN ICELANDIC HORSE. SNOW TEMPEST IMPRACTICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM. HE IS BRAVE HE IS SOBER HE IS SAFE HE NEVER MAKES A FALSE STEP NEVER GLIDES OR SLIPS FROM HIS PATH. I DARE TO SAY THAT IF ANY RIVER ANY FJORD HAS TO BE CROSSED AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THERE WILL BE MANY YOU WILL SEE HIM ENTER THE WATER WITHOUT HESITATION LIKE AN AMPHIBIOUS ANIMAL AND REACH THE OPPOSITE SIDE IN SAFETY. WE MUST NOT HOWEVER ATTEMPT TO HURRY HIM WE MUST ALLOW HIM TO HAVE HIS OWN WAY AND I WILL UNDERTAKE TO SAY THAT BETWEEN US WE SHALL DO OUR TEN LEAGUES A DAY. WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE. HE MOVES SO LITTLE THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BECOME FATIGUED. BESIDES IF HE WERE TO COMPLAIN OF WEARINESS HE COULD HAVE THE LOAN OF MY HORSE. I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXERCISE. MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF. ALL THIS WHILE WE WERE ADVANCING AT A RAPID PACE. THE COUNTRY WE HAD REACHED WAS ALREADY NEARLY A DESERT. HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BUR OR ICELANDIC HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE. THESE WRETCHED AND MISERABLE HUTS EXCITED IN US SUCH PITY THAT WE FELT HALF DISPOSED TO LEAVE ALMS AT EVERY DOOR. WHAT THEN MUST BE THE STATE OF THE LESS KNOWN AND MORE DISTANT PARTS OF THE ISLAND. A FEW STRAY COWS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY. WE WERE TO LEARN THIS ALL IN GOOD TIME. LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNEFFELS WHERE AGGLOMERATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS. SOME TWO HOURS OR MORE AFTER WE HAD LEFT THE CITY OF REYKJAVIK WE REACHED THE LITTLE TOWN CALLED AOALKIRKJA OR THE PRINCIPAL CHURCH. IT CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
