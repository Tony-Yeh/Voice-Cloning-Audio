PUT THE UDDER INTO A STEWPAN WITH SUFFICIENT WATER TO COVER IT LET IT STEW GENTLY TILL QUITE DONE WHEN TAKE IT OUT TO COOL. THAT PORTION WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE STRAINER IS ONE OF THE THREE INGREDIENTS OF WHICH FRENCH FORCEMEATS ARE GENERALLY COMPOSED BUT MANY COOKS SUBSTITUTE BUTTER FOR THIS BEING A LESS TROUBLESOME AND MORE EXPEDITIOUS MODE OF PREPARATION. ILLUSTRATION PESTLE AND MORTAR. PESTLE AND MORTAR NO COOKERY CAN BE PERFECTLY PERFORMED WITHOUT THE AID OF THE USEFUL INSTRUMENTS SHOWN IN THE ENGRAVING. FOR POUNDING THINGS SUFFICIENTLY FINE THEY ARE INVALUABLE AND THE USE OF THEM WILL SAVE A GOOD DEAL OF TIME BESIDES INCREASING THE EXCELLENCE OF THE PREPARATIONS. THEY ARE MADE OF IRON AND IN THAT MATERIAL CAN BE BOUGHT CHEAP BUT AS THESE ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR ALL PURPOSES WE SHOULD RECOMMEND AS MORE ECONOMICAL IN THE END THOSE MADE OF WEDGWOOD ALTHOUGH THESE ARE CONSIDERABLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE FORMER. VEAL QUENELLES. WHEN THE THREE INGREDIENTS ARE PROPERLY PREPARED POUND THEM ALTOGETHER IN A MORTAR FOR SOME TIME FOR THE MORE QUENELLES ARE POUNDED THE MORE DELICATE THEY ARE. IF THE QUENELLES ARE NOT FIRM ENOUGH ADD THE YOLK OF ANOTHER EGG BUT OMIT THE WHITE WHICH ONLY MAKES THEM HOLLOW AND PUFFY INSIDE. IN THE PREPARATION OF THIS RECIPE IT WOULD BE WELL TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE INGREDIENTS ARE TO BE WELL POUNDED AND SEASONED AND MUST BE MADE HARD OR SOFT ACCORDING TO THE DISHES THEY ARE INTENDED FOR. FOR BROWN OR WHITE RAGOUTS THEY SHOULD BE FIRM AND WHEN THE QUENELLES ARE USED VERY SMALL EXTREME DELICACY WILL BE NECESSARY IN THEIR PREPARATION. NOTE THE FRENCH ARE NOTED FOR THEIR SKILL IN MAKING FORCEMEATS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF THEIR SUPERIORITY IN THIS RESPECT BEING THAT THEY POUND ALL THE INGREDIENTS SO DILIGENTLY AND THOROUGHLY. ANY ONE WITH THE SLIGHTEST PRETENSIONS TO REFINED COOKERY MUST IN THIS PARTICULAR IMPLICITLY FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF OUR FRIENDS ACROSS THE CHANNEL. FORCEMEAT OR QUENELLES FOR TURTLE SOUP. FRIED BREAD CRUMBS. CUT THE BREAD INTO THIN SLICES PLACE THEM IN A COOL OVEN OVERNIGHT AND WHEN THOROUGHLY DRY AND CRISP ROLL THEM DOWN INTO FINE CRUMBS. DIRECTLY THEY ARE DONE LIFT THEM OUT WITH A SLICE AND DRAIN THEM BEFORE THE FIRE FROM ALL GREASY MOISTURE. WHEN QUITE CRISP THEY ARE READY FOR USE. THE FAT THEY ARE FRIED IN SHOULD BE CLEAR AND THE CRUMBS SHOULD NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST APPEARANCE OR TASTE OF HAVING BEEN IN THE LEAST DEGREE BURNT. FRIED BREAD FOR BORDERS. PROCEED AS ABOVE BY FRYING SOME SLICES OF BREAD CUT IN ANY FANCIFUL SHAPE. WHEN QUITE CRISP DIP ONE SIDE OF THE SIPPET INTO THE BEATEN WHITE OF AN EGG MIXED WITH A LITTLE FLOUR AND PLACE IT ON THE EDGE OF THE DISH. CONTINUE IN THIS MANNER TILL THE BORDER IS COMPLETED ARRANGING THE SIPPETS A PALE AND A DARK ONE ALTERNATELY. MODE CUT UP THE ONION AND CARROT INTO SMALL RINGS AND PUT THEM INTO A STEWPAN WITH THE HERBS MUSHROOMS BAY LEAF CLOVES AND MACE ADD THE BUTTER AND SIMMER THE WHOLE VERY GENTLY OVER A SLOW FIRE UNTIL THE ONION IS QUITE TENDER. POUR IN THE STOCK AND SHERRY AND STEW SLOWLY FOR ONE HOUR WHEN STRAIN IT OFF INTO A CLEAN SAUCEPAN. NOW MAKE A THICKENING OF BUTTER AND FLOUR PUT IT TO THE SAUCE STIR IT OVER THE FIRE UNTIL PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND MELLOW ADD THE LEMON JUICE GIVE ONE BOIL WHEN IT WILL BE READY FOR TABLE. TIME ALTOGETHER TWO HOURS. SUFFICIENT HALF THIS QUANTITY FOR TWO SLICES OF SALMON. ILLUSTRATION SAGE.
