YET PITY STILL DEFENDS OUR EARTHLY SHARE IN THAT SWEET SOUL GOD ANSWERING THUS THE PRAYER MY WELL BELOVED SUFFER THAT IN PEACE YOUR HOPE REMAIN WHILE SO MY PLEASURE IS THERE WHERE ONE DWELLS WHO DREADS THE LOSS OF HER AND WHO IN HELL UNTO THE DOOMED SHALL SAY I HAVE LOOKED ON THAT FOR WHICH GOD'S CHOSEN PRAY. MY LADY IS DESIRED IN THE HIGH HEAVEN WHEREFORE IT NOW BEHOVETH ME TO TELL SAYING LET ANY MAID THAT WOULD BE WELL ESTEEMED KEEP WITH HER FOR AS SHE GOES BY INTO FOUL HEARTS A DEATHLY CHILL IS DRIVEN BY LOVE THAT MAKES ILL THOUGHT TO PERISH THERE WHILE ANY WHO ENDURES TO GAZE ON HER MUST EITHER BE ENNOBLED OR ELSE DIE. ALSO THIS VIRTUE OWNS SHE BY GOD'S WILL WHO SPEAKS WITH HER CAN NEVER COME TO ILL LOVE SAITH CONCERNING HER HOW CHANCETH IT THAT FLESH WHICH IS OF DUST SHOULD BE THUS PURE. SHE HATH THAT PALENESS OF THE PEARL THAT'S FIT IN A FAIR WOMAN SO MUCH AND NOT MORE SHE IS AS HIGH AS NATURE'S SKILL CAN SOAR BEAUTY IS TRIED BY HER COMPARISON. WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE DO ISSUE THENCE IN FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HEART'S DEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE. AND IN HER SMILE LOVE'S IMAGE YOU MAY SEE WHENCE NONE CAN GAZE UPON HER STEADFASTLY. TO HER I WEND ALONG IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS IS MADE STRONG. SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADY LOVE. COMMEND THOU ME TO EACH AS DOTH BEHOVE. THIS POEM THAT IT MAY BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD I WILL DIVIDE MORE SUBTLY THAN THE OTHERS PRECEDING AND THEREFORE I WILL MAKE THREE PARTS OF IT. THE FIRST PART IS A PROEM TO THE WORDS FOLLOWING. THE SECOND IS THE MATTER TREATED OF. THE THIRD IS AS IT WERE A HANDMAID TO THE PRECEDING WORDS. THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE DEAR SONG I KNOW. THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR. IN THE FIRST I SAY TO WHOM I MEAN TO SPEAK OF MY LADY AND WHEREFORE I WILL SO SPEAK. IN THE SECOND I SAY WHAT SHE APPEARS TO MYSELF TO BE WHEN I REFLECT UPON HER EXCELLENCE AND WHAT I WOULD UTTER IF I LOST NOT COURAGE. IN THE THIRD I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPEDED BY FAINTHEARTEDNESS. IN THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM I PURPOSE SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO THEM. THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AND I DECLARE THE THIRD HERE WHEREFORE I WILL NOT SPEAK THE FOURTH HERE WITH YOU ALONE. THEN WHEN I SAY AN ANGEL I BEGIN TREATING OF THIS LADY AND THIS PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO. IN THE FIRST I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER IN HEAVEN. IN THE SECOND I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HERE MY LADY IS DESIRED. THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELATING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRATING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVE SAITH CONCERNING HER. THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE ONE I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF THE MOUTH WHICH IS THE END OF LOVE. AND THAT EVERY VICIOUS THOUGHT MAY BE DISCARDED HEREFROM LET THE READER REMEMBER THAT IT IS ABOVE WRITTEN THAT THE GREETING OF THIS LADY WHICH WAS AN ACT OF HER MOUTH WAS THE GOAL OF MY DESIRES WHILE I COULD RECEIVE IT. THEN WHEN I SAY DEAR SONG I KNOW I ADD A STANZA AS IT WERE HANDMAID TO THE OTHERS WHEREIN I SAY WHAT I DESIRE FROM THIS MY POEM
