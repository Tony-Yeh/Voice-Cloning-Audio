THEREAFTER THIS SONNET BRED IN ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN IN VERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST. AND I SAID THESE FOUR THINGS IN A SONNET WHICH IS THIS. AT WHILES YEA OFTENTIMES I MUSE OVER THE QUALITY OF ANGUISH THAT IS MINE THROUGH LOVE THEN PITY MAKES MY VOICE TO PINE SAYING IS ANY ELSE THUS ANYWHERE. AND THEN IF I WHOM OTHER AID FORSOOK WOULD AID MYSELF AND INNOCENT OF ART WOULD FAIN HAVE SIGHT OF THEE AS A LAST HOPE NO SOONER DO I LIFT MINE EYES TO LOOK THAN THE BLOOD SEEMS AS SHAKEN FROM MY HEART AND ALL MY PULSES BEAT AT ONCE AND STOP. WHEREFORE I SAY THAT THE SECOND PART BEGINS LOVE SMITETH ME THE THIRD AND THEN IF I THE FOURTH NO SOONER DO I LIFT. BUT ALBEIT I SPAKE NOT TO HER AGAIN YET IT BEHOVED ME AFTERWARD TO WRITE OF ANOTHER MATTER MORE NOBLE THAN THE FOREGOING. AND FOR THAT THE OCCASION OF WHAT I THEN WROTE MAY BE FOUND PLEASANT IN THE HEARING I WILL RELATE IT AS BRIEFLY AS I MAY. THROUGH THE SORE CHANGE IN MINE ASPECT THE SECRET OF MY HEART WAS NOW UNDERSTOOD OF MANY. WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERS TIMES IN MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY. AND AS I WAS GOING THAT WAY BY CHANCE BUT I THINK RATHER BY THE WILL OF FORTUNE I HEARD ONE OF THEM CALL UNTO ME AND SHE THAT CALLED WAS A LADY OF VERY SWEET SPEECH. AND WHEN I HAD COME CLOSE UP WITH THEM AND PERCEIVED THAT THEY HAD NOT AMONG THEM MINE EXCELLENT LADY I WAS REASSURED AND SALUTED THEM ASKING OF THEIR PLEASURE. THE LADIES WERE MANY DIVERS OF WHOM WERE LAUGHING ONE TO ANOTHER WHILE DIVERS GAZED AT ME AS THOUGH I SHOULD SPEAK ANON. BUT WHEN I STILL SPAKE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT END LOVEST THOU THIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE. AND WHEN SHE HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS NOT SHE ONLY BUT ALL THEY THAT WERE WITH HER BEGAN TO OBSERVE ME WAITING FOR MY REPLY. AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MY BEATITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME. THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOW FALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THEIR TALK MINGLED WITH SIGHS. BUT AFTER A LITTLE THAT LADY WHO HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO ADDRESS ME ADDRESSED ME AGAIN IN THESE WORDS WE PRAY THEE THAT THOU WILT TELL US WHEREIN ABIDETH THIS THY BEATITUDE. AND ANSWERING I SAID BUT THUS MUCH IN THOSE WORDS THAT DO PRAISE MY LADY. THEN I BEING ALMOST PUT TO SHAME BECAUSE OF HER ANSWER WENT OUT FROM AMONG THEM AND AS I WALKED I SAID WITHIN MYSELF SEEING THAT THERE IS SO MUCH BEATITUDE IN THOSE WORDS WHICH DO PRAISE MY LADY WHEREFORE HATH MY SPEECH OF HER BEEN DIFFERENT. AND THEN I RESOLVED THAT THENCEFORWARD I WOULD CHOOSE FOR THE THEME OF MY WRITINGS ONLY THE PRAISE OF THIS MOST GRACIOUS BEING. WHEREUPON I DECLARE THAT MY TONGUE SPAKE AS THOUGH BY ITS OWN IMPULSE AND SAID LADIES THAT HAVE INTELLIGENCE IN LOVE. THESE WORDS I LAID UP IN MY MIND WITH GREAT GLADNESS CONCEIVING TO TAKE THEM AS MY COMMENCEMENT. LADIES THAT HAVE INTELLIGENCE IN LOVE OF MINE OWN LADY I WOULD SPEAK WITH YOU NOT THAT I HOPE TO COUNT HER PRAISES THROUGH BUT TELLING WHAT I MAY TO EASE MY MIND. AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHEDS SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT CERTAINLY TO HIM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL RESIGN'D. WHEREFORE I WILL NOT SPEAK IN SUCH LARGE KIND THAT MINE OWN SPEECH SHOULD FOIL ME WHICH WERE BASE BUT ONLY WILL DISCOURSE OF HER HIGH GRACE IN THESE POOR WORDS THE BEST THAT I CAN FIND WITH YOU ALONE DEAR DAMES AND DAMOZELS TWERE ILL TO SPEAK THEREOF WITH ANY ELSE. AN ANGEL OF HIS BLESSED KNOWLEDGE SAITH TO GOD LORD IN THE WORLD THAT THOU HAST MADE A MIRACLE IN ACTION IS DISPLAY'D BY REASON OF A SOUL WHOSE SPLENDOURS FARE EVEN HITHER AND SINCE HEAVEN REQUIRETH NOUGHT SAVING HER FOR HER IT PRAYETH THEE THY SAINTS CRYING ALOUD CONTINUALLY
