THEN FEELING BEWILDERED I CLOSED MINE EYES AND MY BRAIN BEGAN TO BE IN TRAVAIL AS THE BRAIN OF ONE FRANTIC AND TO HAVE SUCH IMAGINATIONS AS HERE FOLLOW. AND AT THE FIRST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SAW CERTAIN FACES OF WOMEN WITH THEIR HAIR LOOSENED WHICH CALLED OUT TO ME THOU SHALT SURELY DIE AFTER THE WHICH OTHER TERRIBLE AND UNKNOWN APPEARANCES SAID UNTO ME THOU ART DEAD. AT LENGTH AS MY PHANTASY HELD ON IN ITS WANDERINGS I CAME TO BE I KNEW NOT WHERE AND TO BEHOLD A THRONG OF DISHEVELLED LADIES WONDERFULLY SAD WHO KEPT GOING HITHER AND THITHER WEEPING. SHE THAT WAS THINE EXCELLENT LADY HATH BEEN TAKEN OUT OF LIFE. THEN I BEGAN TO WEEP VERY PITEOUSLY AND NOT ONLY IN MINE IMAGINATION BUT WITH MINE EYES WHICH WERE WET WITH TEARS. AND WHEN I HAD SEEN ALL THOSE OFFICES PERFORMED THAT ARE FITTING TO BE DONE UNTO THE DEAD IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I WENT BACK UNTO MINE OWN CHAMBER AND LOOKED UP TOWARDS HEAVEN. AND SO STRONG WAS MY PHANTASY THAT I WEPT AGAIN IN VERY TRUTH AND SAID WITH MY TRUE VOICE O EXCELLENT SOUL HOW BLESSED IS HE THAT NOW LOOKETH UPON THEE. AND AS I SAID THESE WORDS WITH A PAINFUL ANGUISH OF SOBBING AND ANOTHER PRAYER UNTO DEATH A YOUNG AND GENTLE LADY WHO HAD BEEN STANDING BESIDE ME WHERE I LAY CONCEIVING THAT I WEPT AND CRIED OUT BECAUSE OF THE PAIN OF MINE INFIRMITY WAS TAKEN WITH TREMBLING AND BEGAN TO SHED TEARS. WHEREBY OTHER LADIES WHO WERE ABOUT THE ROOM BECOMING AWARE OF MY DISCOMFORT BY REASON OF THE MOAN THAT SHE MADE WHO INDEED WAS OF MY VERY NEAR KINDRED LED HER AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS AND THEN SET THEMSELVES TO AWAKEN ME THINKING THAT I DREAMED AND SAYING SLEEP NO LONGER AND BE NOT DISQUIETED. WHEN BEING AROUSED I OPENED MINE EYES AND KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN A DECEPTION. BUT ALBEIT I HAD INDEED UTTERED HER NAME YET MY VOICE WAS SO BROKEN WITH SOBS THAT IT WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THESE LADIES SO THAT IN SPITE OF THE SORE SHAME THAT I FELT I TURNED TOWARDS THEM BY LOVE'S COUNSELLING. AND WHEN THEY BEHELD ME THEY BEGAN TO SAY HE SEEMETH AS ONE DEAD AND TO WHISPER AMONG THEMSELVES LET US STRIVE IF WE MAY NOT COMFORT HIM. WHEREUPON THEY SPAKE TO ME MANY SOOTHING WORDS AND QUESTIONED ME MOREOVER TOUCHING THE CAUSE OF MY FEAR. A VERY PITIFUL LADY VERY YOUNG EXCEEDING RICH IN HUMAN SYMPATHIES STOOD BY WHAT TIME I CLAMOUR'D UPON DEATH AND AT THE WILD WORDS WANDERING ON MY TONGUE AND AT THE PITEOUS LOOK WITHIN MINE EYES SHE WAS AFFRIGHTED THAT SOBS CHOKED HER BREATH. SO BY HER WEEPING WHERE I LAY BENEATH SOME OTHER GENTLE LADIES CAME TO KNOW MY STATE AND MADE HER GO AFTERWARD BENDING THEMSELVES OVER ME ONE SAID AWAKEN THEE. AND ONE WHAT THING THY SLEEP DISQUIETETH. AND MY HUE WAS SUCH THAT THEY LOOK'D AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT OF DEATH SAYING UNDER THEIR BREATH MOST TENDERLY O LET US COMFORT HIM THEN UNTO ME WHAT DREAM WAS THINE THAT IT HATH SHAKEN THEE SO MUCH. AND WHEN I WAS A LITTLE COMFORTED THIS LADIES WAS THE DREAM I DREAMT I SAID. I WAS A THINKING HOW LIFE FAILS WITH US SUDDENLY AFTER SUCH A LITTLE WHILE WHEN LOVE SOBB'D IN MY HEART WHICH IS HIS HOME. AND THEREWITHAL SUCH A BEWILDERMENT POSSESS'D ME THAT I SHUT MINE EYES FOR PEACE AND IN MY BRAIN DID CEASE ORDER OF THOUGHT AND EVERY HEALTHFUL THING. AFTERWARDS WANDERING AMID A SWARM OF DOUBTS THAT CAME AND WENT SOME CERTAIN WOMEN'S FACES HURRIED BY AND SHRIEK'D TO ME THOU TOO SHALT DIE SHALT DIE. THEN SAW I MANY BROKEN HINTED SIGHTS IN THE UNCERTAIN STATE I STEPP'D INTO. THY LADY SHE THAT WAS SO FAIR IS DEAD. THEN LIFTING UP MINE EYES AS THE TEARS CAME I SAW THE ANGELS LIKE A RAIN OF MANNA IN A LONG FLIGHT FLYING BACK HEAVENWARD HAVING A LITTLE CLOUD IN FRONT OF THEM AFTER THE WHICH THEY WENT AND SAID HOSANNA AND IF THEY HAD SAID MORE YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD THEN LOVE SAID NOW SHALL ALL THINGS BE MADE CLEAR COME AND BEHOLD OUR LADY WHERE SHE LIES. THESE WILDERING PHANTASIES THEN CARRIED ME TO SEE MY LADY DEAD. EVEN AS I THERE WAS LED HER LADIES WITH A VEIL WERE COVERING HER AND WITH HER WAS SUCH VERY HUMBLENESS THAT SHE APPEARED TO SAY I AM AT PEACE
