AND I BECAME SO HUMBLE IN MY GRIEF SEEING IN HER SUCH DEEP HUMILITY THAT I SAID DEATH I HOLD THEE PASSING GOOD HENCEFORTH AND A MOST GENTLE SWEET RELIEF SINCE MY DEAR LOVE HAS CHOSEN TO DWELL WITH THEE PITY NOT HATE IS THINE WELL UNDERSTOOD. LO I DO SO DESIRE TO SEE THY FACE THAT I AM LIKE AS ONE WHO NEARS THE TOMB MY SOUL ENTREATS THEE COME. THEN I DEPARTED HAVING MADE MY MOAN AND WHEN I WAS ALONE I SAID AND CAST MY EYES TO THE HIGH PLACE BLESSED IS HE FAIR SOUL WHO MEETS THY GLANCE. JUST THEN YOU WOKE ME OF YOUR COMPLAISAUNCE. THIS POEM HAS TWO PARTS IN THE FIRST SPEAKING TO A PERSON UNDEFINED I TELL HOW I WAS AROUSED FROM A VAIN PHANTASY BY CERTAIN LADIES AND HOW I PROMISED THEM TO TELL WHAT IT WAS. IN THE SECOND I SAY HOW I TOLD THEM. THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE I WAS A THINKING THE FIRST PART DIVIDES INTO TWO. THEN WHEN I SAY I WAS A THINKING I SAY HOW I TOLD THEM THIS MY IMAGINATION AND CONCERNING THIS I HAVE TWO PARTS. IN THE FIRST I TELL IN ORDER THIS IMAGINATION. IN THE SECOND SAYING AT WHAT TIME THEY CALLED ME I COVERTLY THANK THEM AND THIS PART BEGINS HERE JUST THEN YOU WOKE ME. AFTER THIS EMPTY IMAGINING IT HAPPENED ON A DAY AS I SAT THOUGHTFUL THAT I WAS TAKEN WITH SUCH A STRONG TREMBLING AT THE HEART THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE IN THE PRESENCE OF MY LADY. AND WITH THAT MY HEART WAS SO FULL OF GLADNESS THAT I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT TO BE OF VERY TRUTH MINE OWN HEART AND NOT ANOTHER. A SHORT WHILE AFTER THESE WORDS WHICH MY HEART SPOKE TO ME WITH THE TONGUE OF LOVE I SAW COMING TOWARDS ME A CERTAIN LADY WHO WAS VERY FAMOUS FOR HER BEAUTY AND OF WHOM THAT FRIEND WHOM I HAVE ALREADY CALLED THE FIRST AMONG MY FRIENDS HAD LONG BEEN ENAMOURED. THIS LADY'S RIGHT NAME WAS JOAN BUT BECAUSE OF HER COMELINESS OR AT LEAST IT WAS SO IMAGINED SHE WAS CALLED OF MANY PRIMAVERA SPRING AND WENT BY THAT NAME AMONG THEM. AND IN HIS SPEECH HE LAUGH'D AND LAUGH'D AGAIN THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE TO REMAIN I CHANCED TO LOOK THE WAY HE HAD DRAWN NEAR AND SAW THE LADIES JOAN AND BEATRICE APPROACH ME THIS THE OTHER FOLLOWING ONE AND A SECOND MARVEL INSTANTLY. THIS SONNET HAS MANY PARTS WHEREOF THE FIRST TELLS HOW I FELT AWAKENED WITHIN MY HEART THE ACCUSTOMED TREMOR AND HOW IT SEEMED THAT LOVE APPEARED TO ME JOYFUL FROM AFAR. THE SECOND SAYS HOW IT APPEARED TO ME THAT LOVE SPAKE WITHIN MY HEART AND WHAT WAS HIS ASPECT THE THIRD TELLS HOW AFTER HE HAD IN SUCH WISE BEEN WITH ME A SPACE I SAW AND HEARD CERTAIN THINGS. THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE SAYING BE NOW THE THIRD HERE THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE. THE THIRD PART DIVIDES INTO TWO IN THE FIRST I SAY WHAT I SAW
