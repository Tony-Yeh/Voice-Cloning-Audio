NEVERTHELESS OR PERHAPS INDEED IT MAY HAVE BEEN PARTLY ON THAT VERY ACCOUNT HE DID NOT IN THOSE OPENING YEARS READ DANTE TO ANY DEGREE WORTH MENTIONING HE WAS WELL VERSED IN SHAKESPEARE WALTER SCOTT BYRON AND SOME OTHER WRITERS YEARS BEFORE HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO DANTE. FROM READING ROSSETTI WENT ON TO TRANSLATING. HE TRANSLATED AT AN EARLY AGE CHIEFLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE AND EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A GREAT NUMBER OF POEMS BY THE ITALIANS CONTEMPORARY WITH DANTE OR PRECEDING HIM AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MADE A VERSION OF THE WHOLE VITA NUOVA PROSE AND VERSE. THIS MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST IMPORTANT THING THAT HE TRANSLATED FROM THE ITALIAN IF NOT THE FIRST STILL LESS WAS IT THE LAST AND IT MAY WELL BE THAT HIS RENDERING OF THE BOOK WAS COMPLETED WITHIN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX OR EARLY IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN. STILL THE WORK AS WE NOW HAVE IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE WORK OF THOSE ADOLESCENT YEARS FROM TIME TO TIME RECONSIDERED AND IMPROVED BUT NOT TRANSMUTED. THIS PROJECT HOWEVER HAD TO BE LAID ASIDE OWING TO WANT OF MEANS AND THE ETCHINGS WERE NEVER UNDERTAKEN. THIS BOOK IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOUR AND SETTLED THE CLAIM OF ROSSETTI TO RANK AS A POETIC TRANSLATOR OR INDEED AS A POET IN HIS OWN RIGHT. FOR THE EARLY ITALIAN POETS HE WROTE A PREFACE FROM WHICH A PASSAGE IMMEDIATELY RELATING TO THE VITA NUOVA IS EXTRACTED IN THE PRESENT EDITION. THE LIFE BLOOD OF RHYTHMICAL TRANSLATION IS THIS COMMANDMENT THAT A GOOD POEM SHALL NOT BE TURNED INTO A BAD ONE. THE ONLY TRUE MOTIVE FOR PUTTING POETRY INTO A FRESH LANGUAGE MUST BE TO ENDOW A FRESH NATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH ONE MORE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY. POETRY NOT BEING AN EXACT SCIENCE LITERALITY OF RENDERING IS ALTOGETHER SECONDARY TO THIS CHIEF LAW. I SAY LITERALITY NOT FIDELITY WHICH IS BY NO MEANS THE SAME THING. ANY MERIT POSSESSED BY THESE TRANSLATIONS IS DERIVED FROM AN EFFORT TO FOLLOW THIS PRINCIPLE. THE TASK OF THE TRANSLATOR AND WITH ALL HUMILITY BE IT SPOKEN IS ONE OF SOME SELF DENIAL. OFTEN WOULD HE AVAIL HIMSELF OF ANY SPECIAL GRACE OF HIS OWN IDIOM AND EPOCH IF ONLY HIS WILL BELONGED TO HIM OFTEN WOULD SOME CADENCE SERVE HIM BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S STRUCTURE SOME STRUCTURE BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S CADENCE OFTEN THE BEAUTIFUL TURN OF A STANZA MUST BE WEAKENED TO ADOPT SOME RHYME WHICH WILL TALLY AND HE SEES THE POET REVELLING IN ABUNDANCE OF LANGUAGE WHERE HIMSELF IS SCANTILY SUPPLIED. NOW HE WOULD SLIGHT THE MATTER FOR THE MUSIC AND NOW THE MUSIC FOR THE MATTER BUT NO HE MUST DEAL TO EACH ALIKE. SOMETIMES TOO A FLAW IN THE WORK GALLS HIM AND HE WOULD FAIN REMOVE IT DOING FOR THE POET THAT WHICH HIS AGE DENIED HIM BUT NO IT IS NOT IN THE BOND. IT MAY BE AS WELL TO EXPLAIN HERE A VERY SMALL SHARE WHICH I MYSELF TOOK IN THE VITA NUOVA TRANSLATION. HE DEFINED THE WORK FURTHER AS FOLLOWS WHAT I WANT IS THAT YOU SHOULD CORRECT MY TRANSLATION THROUGHOUT REMOVING INACCURACIES AND MANNERISMS. AND IF YOU HAVE TIME IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO TRANSLATE THE ANALYSES OF THE POEMS WHICH I OMITTED. THIS HOWEVER IF YOU THINK IT DESIRABLE TO INCLUDE THEM. I DID NOT AT THE TIME ON GROUND OF READABLENESS BUT SINCE THINK THEY MAY BE DESIRABLE ONLY HAVE BECOME SO UNFAMILIAR WITH THE BOOK THAT I HAVE NO DISTINCT OPINION. ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH HE WROTE MANY AND MANY THANKS FOR A MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE MOST THOROUGHLY PERFORMED. MY NOTES WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE OF REVISING ARE OF COURSE QUITE PALTRY AND USELESS. HEAR HOW MUCH LOVE DID HER HONOURING FOR I SAW HIM LAMENTING IN VERY PERSON OVER THE DEAD SEEMLY IMAGE AND OFTEN HE GAZED TOWARDS HEAVEN WHEREIN WAS ALREADY SETTLED THE NOBLE SOUL WHO HAD BEEN A LADY OF SUCH GLADSOME SEMBLANCE. IT WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE TO ENTER HERE INTO ANY DETAILED OBSERVATIONS UPON THE VITA NUOVA ITS MEANING AND THE LITERATURE WHICH HAS GROWN OUT OF IT. IT IS THEREFORE AND ON ALL ACCOUNTS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MUCH MORE OF THE WORK HERE THAN IT SAYS FOR ITSELF. THROUGHOUT THE VITA NUOVA THERE IS A STRAIN LIKE THE FIRST FALLING MURMUR WHICH REACHES THE EAR IN SOME REMOTE MEADOW AND PREPARES US TO LOOK UPON THE SEA
