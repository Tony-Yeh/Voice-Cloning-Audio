SOYER RECOMMENDS THAT EACH SLICE SHOULD BE CUT INTO PIECES AS SOON AS IT IS BUTTERED AND WHEN ALL ARE READY THAT THEY SHOULD BE PILED LIGHTLY ON THE DISH THEY ARE INTENDED TO BE SERVED ON. HE SAYS THAT BY CUTTING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE SLICES AT A TIME ALL THE BUTTER IS SQUEEZED OUT OF THE UPPER ONES WHILE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SWIMMING IN FAT LIQUID. IT IS HIGHLY ESSENTIAL TO USE GOOD BUTTER FOR MAKING THIS DISH. MUFFINS. SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVEN. ILLUSTRATION MUFFINS. THEN PLACE THEM CAREFULLY ON A HOT PLATE OR STOVE AND BAKE THEM UNTIL THEY ARE SLIGHTLY BROWNED TURNING THEM WHEN THEY ARE DONE ON ONE SIDE. MUFFINS ARE NOT EASILY MADE AND ARE MORE GENERALLY PURCHASED THAN MANUFACTURED AT HOME. TO TOAST THEM DIVIDE THE EDGE OF THE MUFFIN ALL ROUND BY PULLING IT OPEN TO THE DEPTH OF ABOUT AN INCH WITH THE FINGERS. DO NOT TOAST THEM TOO QUICKLY AS IF THIS IS DONE THE MIDDLE OF THE MUFFIN WILL NOT BE WARMED THROUGH.

TURN IT AND BROWN THE OTHER SIDE THEN SPREAD IT WITH GOOD BUTTER CUT IT IN HALF AND WHEN ALL ARE DONE PILE THEM ON A HOT DISH AND SEND THEM QUICKLY TO TABLE. MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS SHOULD ALWAYS BE SERVED ON SEPARATE DISHES AND BOTH TOASTED AND SERVED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. TIME FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES TO BAKE THEM.
