MISS ACTON'S RECIPE. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. ILLUSTRATION COTTAGE LOAF. ILLUSTRATION TIN BREAD. MODE PUT THE FLOUR INTO A LARGE EARTHENWARE BOWL OR DEEP PAN THEN WITH A STRONG METAL OR WOODEN SPOON HOLLOW OUT THE MIDDLE BUT DO NOT CLEAR IT ENTIRELY AWAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AS IN THAT CASE THE SPONGE OR LEAVEN AS IT WAS FORMERLY TERMED WOULD STICK TO IT WHICH IT OUGHT NOT TO DO. NEXT TAKE EITHER A LARGE TABLESPOONFUL OF BREWER'S YEAST WHICH HAS BEEN RENDERED SOLID BY MIXING IT WITH PLENTY OF COLD WATER AND LETTING IT AFTERWARDS STAND TO SETTLE FOR A DAY AND NIGHT OR NEARLY AN OUNCE OF GERMAN YEAST PUT IT INTO A LARGE BASIN AND PROCEED TO MIX IT SO THAT IT SHALL BE AS SMOOTH AS CREAM WITH THREE QUARTERS PINT OF WARM MILK AND WATER OR WITH WATER ONLY THOUGH EVEN A VERY LITTLE MILK WILL MUCH IMPROVE THE BREAD. POUR THE YEAST INTO THE HOLE MADE IN THE FLOUR AND STIR INTO IT AS MUCH OF THAT WHICH LIES ROUND IT AS WILL MAKE A THICK BATTER IN WHICH THERE MUST BE NO LUMPS. LOOK AT IT FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN IT HAS BEEN LAID FOR NEARLY AN HOUR AND WHEN THE YEAST HAS RISEN AND BROKEN THROUGH THE FLOUR SO THAT BUBBLES APPEAR IN IT YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT IS READY TO BE MADE UP INTO DOUGH. THEN PLACE THE PAN ON A STRONG CHAIR OR DRESSER OR TABLE OF CONVENIENT HEIGHT POUR INTO THE SPONGE THE REMAINDER OF THE WARM MILK AND WATER STIR INTO IT AS MUCH OF THE FLOUR AS YOU CAN WITH THE SPOON THEN WIPE IT OUT CLEAN WITH YOUR FINGERS AND LAY IT ASIDE. WHEN THE FLOUR IS NEARLY ALL KNEADED IN BEGIN TO DRAW THE EDGES OF THE DOUGH TOWARDS THE MIDDLE IN ORDER TO MIX THE WHOLE THOROUGHLY AND WHEN IT IS FREE FROM FLOUR AND LUMPS AND CRUMBS AND DOES NOT STICK TO THE HANDS WHEN TOUCHED IT WILL BE DONE AND MAY AGAIN BE COVERED WITH THE CLOTH AND LEFT TO RISE A SECOND TIME. IN THREE QUARTERS HOUR LOOK AT IT AND SHOULD IT HAVE SWOLLEN VERY MUCH AND BEGIN TO CRACK IT WILL BE LIGHT ENOUGH TO BAKE. TURN IT THEN ON TO A PASTE BOARD OR VERY CLEAN DRESSER AND WITH A LARGE SHARP KNIFE DIVIDE IT IN TWO MAKE IT UP QUICKLY INTO LOAVES AND DISPATCH IT TO THE OVEN MAKE ONE OR TWO INCISIONS ACROSS THE TOPS OF THE LOAVES AS THEY WILL RISE MORE EASILY IF THIS BE DONE. IF BAKED IN TINS OR PANS RUB THEM WITH A TINY PIECE OF BUTTER LAID ON A PIECE OF CLEAN PAPER TO PREVENT THE DOUGH FROM STICKING TO THEM. ALL BREAD SHOULD BE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN OR ON ITS SIDE AS SOON AS IT IS DRAWN FROM THE OVEN IF THIS BE NEGLECTED THE UNDER PART OF THE LOAVES WILL BECOME WET AND BLISTERED FROM THE STEAM WHICH CANNOT THEN ESCAPE FROM THEM
