LARGE RAFT LIKE BARGES CONVEY THIS GRAIN DOWN THE RIVERS FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY TO THE SEAPORTS. THIS CORN IS DESCRIBED AS BEING WHITE HARD AND THIN SKINNED AND IT YIELDS A LARGE QUANTITY OF FLOUR HAVING A SMALL PROPORTION OF BRAN. EXCELLENT ROLLS. SEVENTEEN TWENTY THREE. ILLUSTRATION ROLLS. PUT THE FLOUR INTO A PAN STIR IN THE ABOVE INGREDIENTS AND LET THE DOUGH RISE COVERED IN A WARM PLACE. KNEAD IT WELL MAKE IT INTO ROLLS LET THEM RISE AGAIN FOR A FEW MINUTES AND BAKE IN A QUICK OVEN.

SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR. AS SOON AS THE ROLLS COME FROM THE BAKER'S THEY SHOULD BE PUT INTO THE OVEN WHICH IN THE EARLY PART OF THE MORNING IS SURE NOT TO BE VERY HOT AND THE ROLLS MUST NOT BE BUTTERED UNTIL WANTED. WHEN THEY ARE QUITE HOT DIVIDE THEM LENGTHWISE INTO THREE PUT SOME THIN FLAKES OF GOOD BUTTER BETWEEN THE SLICES PRESS THE ROLLS TOGETHER AND PUT THEM IN THE OVEN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BUT NOT LONGER OR THE BUTTER WOULD OIL TAKE THEM OUT OF THE OVEN SPREAD THE BUTTER EQUALLY OVER DIVIDE THE ROLLS IN HALF AND PUT THEM ON TO A VERY HOT CLEAN DISH AND SEND THEM INSTANTLY TO TABLE. TO MAKE DRY TOAST. SEVENTEEN TWENTY FIVE. TO MAKE DRY TOAST PROPERLY A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION IS REQUIRED MUCH MORE INDEED THAN PEOPLE GENERALLY SUPPOSE. NEVER USE NEW BREAD FOR MAKING ANY KIND OF TOAST AS IT EATS HEAVY AND BESIDES IS VERY EXTRAVAGANT. MOVE IT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS UNTIL THE BREAD IS NICELY COLOURED THEN TURN IT AND TOAST THE OTHER SIDE AND DO NOT PLACE IT SO NEAR THE FIRE THAT IT BLACKENS. DRY TOAST SHOULD BE MORE GRADUALLY MADE THAN BUTTERED TOAST AS ITS GREAT BEAUTY CONSISTS IN ITS CRISPNESS AND THIS CANNOT BE ATTAINED UNLESS THE PROCESS IS SLOW AND THE BREAD IS ALLOWED GRADUALLY TO COLOUR.

WHEN OF A NICE COLOUR ON BOTH SIDES PUT IT ON A HOT PLATE DIVIDE SOME GOOD BUTTER INTO SMALL PIECES PLACE THEM ON THE TOAST SET THIS BEFORE THE FIRE AND WHEN THE BUTTER IS JUST BEGINNING TO MELT SPREAD IT LIGHTLY OVER THE TOAST. TRIM OFF THE CRUST AND RAGGED EDGES DIVIDE EACH ROUND INTO FOUR PIECES AND SEND THE TOAST QUICKLY TO TABLE. SOME PERSONS CUT THE SLICES OF TOAST ACROSS FROM CORNER TO CORNER SO MAKING THE PIECES OF A THREE CORNERED SHAPE
