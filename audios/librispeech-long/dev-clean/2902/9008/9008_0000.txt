IT HAD BEEN CHOSEN BY ITS OCCUPANT NOT MERELY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS QUIET FOR THOUGH IT WAS TOLERABLY OUT OF HEARING OF THE FEMALE SLAVES WHO WORKED AND CHATTERED AND QUARRELLED UNDER THE CLOISTERS OF THE WOMEN'S COURT ON THE SOUTH SIDE YET IT WAS EXPOSED TO THE RATTLE OF CARRIAGES AND THE VOICES OF PASSENGERS IN THE FASHIONABLE STREET BELOW AND TO STRANGE BURSTS OF ROARING SQUEALING TRUMPETING FROM THE MENAGERIE A SHORT WAY OFF ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET. THE ATTRACTION OF THE SITUATION LAY PERHAPS IN THE VIEW WHICH IT COMMANDED OVER THE WALL OF THE MUSEUM GARDENS OF FLOWER BEDS SHRUBBERIES FOUNTAINS STATUES WALKS AND ALCOVES WHICH HAD ECHOED FOR NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS TO THE WISDOM OF THE ALEXANDRIAN SAGES AND POETS. SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL THEY HAD ALL WALKED AND TAUGHT AND SUNG THERE BENEATH THE SPREADING PLANES AND CHESTNUTS FIGS AND PALM TREES. THE PLACE SEEMED FRAGRANT WITH ALL THE RICHES OF GREEK THOUGHT AND SONG SINCE THE DAYS WHEN PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS WALKED THERE WITH EUCLID AND THEOCRITUS CALLIMACHUS AND LYCOPHRON. ON THE LEFT OF THE GARDEN STRETCHED THE LOFTY EASTERN FRONT OF THE MUSEUM ITSELF WITH ITS PICTURE GALLERIES HALLS OF STATUARY DINING HALLS AND LECTURE ROOMS ONE HUGE WING CONTAINING THAT FAMOUS LIBRARY FOUNDED BY THE FATHER OF PHILADELPHUS WHICH HOLD IN THE TIME OF SENECA EVEN AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF A GREAT PART OF IT IN CAESAR'S SIEGE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MANUSCRIPTS. THERE IT TOWERED UP THE WONDER OF THE WORLD ITS WHITE ROOF BRIGHT AGAINST THE RAINLESS BLUE AND BEYOND IT AMONG THE RIDGES AND PEDIMENTS OF NOBLE BUILDINGS A BROAD GLIMPSE OF THE BRIGHT BLUE SEA. THE ROOM WAS FITTED UP IN THE PUREST GREEK STYLE NOT WITHOUT AN AFFECTATION OF ARCHAISM IN THE SEVERE FORMS AND SUBDUED HALF TINTS OF THE FRESCOES WHICH ORNAMENTED THE WALLS WITH SCENES FROM THE OLD MYTHS OF ATHENE. YET THE GENERAL EFFECT EVEN UNDER THE BLAZING SUN WHICH POURED IN THROUGH THE MOSQUITO NETS OF THE COURTYARD WINDOWS WAS ONE OF EXQUISITE COOLNESS AND CLEANLINESS AND REPOSE. THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFA BED A TABLE AND AN ARM CHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VASES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE WRITE. BUT MOST PROBABLY HAD ANY OF US ENTERED THAT ROOM THAT MORNING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPARE A LOOK EITHER FOR THE FURNITURE OR THE GENERAL EFFECT OR THE MUSEUM GARDENS OR THE SPARKLING MEDITERRANEAN BEYOND BUT WE SHOULD HAVE AGREED THAT THE ROOM WAS QUITE RICH ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EYES FOR THE SAKE OF ONE TREASURE WHICH IT POSSESSED AND BESIDE WHICH NOTHING WAS WORTH A MOMENT'S GLANCE. THERE MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO US TOO MUCH SADNESS IN THAT CLEAR GRAY EYE TOO MUCH SELF CONSCIOUS RESTRAINT IN THOSE SHARP CURVED LIPS TOO MUCH AFFECTATION IN THE STUDIED SEVERITY OF HER POSTURE AS SHE READ COPIED AS IT SEEMED FROM SOME OLD VASE OR BAS RELIEF. BUT THE GLORIOUS GRACE AND BEAUTY OF EVERY LINE OF FACE AND FIGURE WOULD HAVE EXCUSED EVEN HIDDEN THOSE DEFECTS AND WE SHOULD HAVE ONLY RECOGNISED THE MARKED RESEMBLANCE TO THE IDEAL PORTRAITS OF ATHENE WHICH ADORNED EVERY PANEL OF THE WALLS. SHE HAS LIFTED HER EYES OFF HER MANUSCRIPT SHE IS LOOKING OUT WITH KINDLING COUNTENANCE OVER THE GARDENS OF THE MUSEUM HER RIPE CURLING GREEK LIPS SUCH AS WE NEVER SEE NOW EVEN AMONG HER OWN WIVES AND SISTERS OPEN. SHE IS TALKING TO HERSELF LISTEN. YES THE STATUES THERE ARE BROKEN. THE LIBRARIES ARE PLUNDERED. THE ALCOVES ARE SILENT THE ORACLES ARE DUMB. AND YET WHO SAYS THAT THE OLD FAITH OF HEROES AND SAGES IS DEAD. THE BEAUTIFUL CAN NEVER DIE
