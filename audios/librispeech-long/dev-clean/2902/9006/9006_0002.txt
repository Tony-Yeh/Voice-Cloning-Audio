AND EVEN FOR THE WESTERN CHURCH THE LOFTY FUTURE WHICH WAS IN STORE FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT SOME INFUSION OF NEW AND HEALTHIER BLOOD INTO THE VEINS OF A WORLD DRAINED AND TAINTED BY THE INFLUENCE OF ROME. AND THE NEW BLOOD AT THE ERA OF THIS STORY WAS AT HAND. THE GREAT TIDE OF THOSE GOTHIC NATIONS OF WHICH THE NORWEGIAN AND THE GERMAN ARE THE PUREST REMAINING TYPES THOUGH EVERY NATION OF EUROPE FROM GIBRALTAR TO SAINT PETERSBURG OWES TO THEM THE MOST PRECIOUS ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH WAS SWEEPING ONWARD WAVE OVER WAVE IN A STEADY SOUTH WESTERN CURRENT ACROSS THE WHOLE ROMAN TERRITORY AND ONLY STOPPING AND RECOILING WHEN IT REACHED THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN. AND THEIR STRENGTH WAS FELT AT ONCE. THEIR VANGUARD CONFINED WITH DIFFICULTY FOR THREE CENTURIES BEYOND THE EASTERN ALPS AT THE EXPENSE OF SANGUINARY WARS HAD BEEN ADOPTED WHEREVER IT WAS PRACTICABLE INTO THE SERVICE OF THE EMPIRE AND THE HEART'S CORE OF THE ROMAN LEGION WAS COMPOSED OF GOTHIC OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS. BUT NOW THE MAIN BODY HAD ARRIVED. TRIBE AFTER TRIBE WAS CROWDING DOWN TO THE ALPS AND TRAMPLING UPON EACH OTHER ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE. THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOWLANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND ROMAN WEAKNESS A CASUS BELLI WAS SOON FOUND. HOW INIQUITOUS WAS THE CONDUCT OF THE SONS OF THEODOSIUS IN REFUSING THE USUAL BOUNTY BY WHICH THE GOTHS WERE BRIBED NOT TO ATTACK THE EMPIRE THE WHOLE PENT UP DELUGE BURST OVER THE PLAINS OF ITALY AND THE WESTERN EMPIRE BECAME FROM THAT DAY FORTH A DYING IDIOT WHILE THE NEW INVADERS DIVIDED EUROPE AMONG THEMSELVES. THE FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF THIS TALE HAD DECIDED THE FATE OF GREECE THE LAST FOUR THAT OF ROME ITSELF. THE COUNTLESS TREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF RAPINE HAD ACCUMULATED ROUND THE CAPITOL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEPSKINS AND HORSE HIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVE AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW KINGDOMS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE NEWLY ARRIVED VANDALS ACROSS THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COAST LAND OF NORTHERN AFRICA. EVERYWHERE THE MANGLED LIMBS OF THE OLD WORLD WERE SEETHING IN THE MEDEA'S CALDRON TO COME FORTH WHOLE AND YOUNG AND STRONG. A FEW MORE TUMULTUOUS YEARS AND THE FRANKS WOULD FIND THEMSELVES LORDS OF THE LOWER RHINELAND AND BEFORE THE HAIRS OF HYPATIA'S SCHOLARS HAD GROWN GRAY THE MYTHIC HENGIST AND HORSA WOULD HAVE LANDED ON THE SHORES OF KENT AND AN ENGLISH NATION HAVE BEGUN ITS WORLD WIDE LIFE. BUT SOME GREAT PROVIDENCE FORBADE TO OUR RACE TRIUMPHANT IN EVERY OTHER QUARTER A FOOTING BEYOND THE MEDITERRANEAN OR EVEN IN CONSTANTINOPLE WHICH TO THIS DAY PRESERVES IN EUROPE THE FAITH AND MANNERS OF ASIA. THE EASTERN WORLD SEEMED BARRED BY SOME STERN DOOM FROM THE ONLY INFLUENCE WHICH COULD HAVE REGENERATED IT. THAT EXTRAORDINARY REFORM IN MORALS WHICH ACCORDING TO SALVIAN AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE VANDAL CONQUERORS WORKED IN NORTH AFRICA AVAILED THEM NOTHING THEY LOST MORE THAN THEY GAVE. CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE AND THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND DEBAUCHED SLAVE HOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE THAT THE GOTHIC RACES WOULD EXERCISE ON THE EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE WESTERN HAD BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE. THE EGYPTIAN AND SYRIAN CHURCHES THEREFORE WERE DESTINED TO LABOUR NOT FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR US
