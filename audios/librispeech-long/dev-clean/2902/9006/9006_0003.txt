THE SIGNS OF DISEASE AND DECREPITUDE WERE ALREADY BUT TOO MANIFEST IN THEM. THAT VERY PECULIAR TURN OF THE GRAECO EASTERN MIND WHICH MADE THEM THE GREAT THINKERS OF THE THEN WORLD HAD THE EFFECT OF DRAWING THEM AWAY FROM PRACTICE TO SPECULATION AND THE RACES OF EGYPT AND SYRIA WERE EFFEMINATE OVER CIVILISED EXHAUSTED BY CENTURIES DURING WHICH NO INFUSION OF FRESH BLOOD HAD COME TO RENEW THE STOCK. MORBID SELF CONSCIOUS PHYSICALLY INDOLENT INCAPABLE THEN AS NOW OF PERSONAL OR POLITICAL FREEDOM THEY AFFORDED MATERIAL OUT OF WHICH FANATICS MIGHT EASILY BE MADE BUT NOT CITIZENS OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD. SUCH A PEOPLE COULD OFFER NO RESISTANCE TO THE STEADILY INCREASING TYRANNY OF THE EASTERN EMPIRE. BUT AT THE PERIOD WHEREOF THIS STORY TREATS THE GRAECO EASTERN MIND WAS STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS GREAT WORK. THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMOOUSIOS AND HOMOIOUSIOS MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE EFFETE REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE. MONASTIC ISOLATION FROM FAMILY AND NATIONAL DUTIES ESPECIALLY FITTED THE FATHERS OF THAT PERIOD FOR THE TASK BY GIVING THEM LEISURE IF NOTHING ELSE TO FACE QUESTIONS WITH A LIFELONG EARNESTNESS IMPOSSIBLE TO THE MORE SOCIAL AND PRACTICAL NORTHERN MIND. I AM INCLINED HOWEVER FOR VARIOUS HISTORICAL REASONS TO DATE HER DEATH TWO YEARS EARLIER THAN HE DOES. THE TRADITION THAT SHE WAS THE WIFE OF ISIDORE THE PHILOSOPHER I REJECT WITH GIBBON AS A PALPABLE ANACHRONISM OF AT LEAST FIFTY YEARS ISIDORE'S MASTER PROCLUS NOT HAVING BEEN BORN TILL THE YEAR BEFORE HYPATIA'S DEATH CONTRADICTED MOREOVER BY THE VERY AUTHOR OF IT PHOTIUS WHO SAYS DISTINCTLY AFTER COMPARING HYPATIA AND ISIDORE THAT ISIDORE MARRIED A CERTAIN DOMNA. NO HINT MOREOVER OF HER HAVING BEEN MARRIED APPEARS IN ANY CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS AND THE NAME OF ISIDORE NOWHERE OCCURS AMONG THOSE OF THE MANY MUTUAL FRIENDS TO WHOM SYNESIUS SENDS MESSAGES IN HIS LETTERS TO HYPATIA IN WHICH IF ANYWHERE WE SHOULD FIND MENTION OF A HUSBAND HAD ONE EXISTED. TO SYNESIUS'S MOST CHARMING LETTERS AS WELL AS TO THOSE OF ISIDORE THE GOOD ABBOT OF PELUSIUM I BEG LEAVE TO REFER THOSE READERS WHO WISH FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE FIFTH CENTURY. I CANNOT HOPE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM ANACHRONISMS AND ERRORS
