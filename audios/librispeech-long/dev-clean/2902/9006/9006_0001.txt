JULIAN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAGANISM BY IMPERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF NEW OPINION ROLLED ON UNCHECKED AND THE RULERS OF EARTH WERE FAIN TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO ACCEPT IN WORDS AT LEAST THE CHURCH'S LAWS AS THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HOMAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO CALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POORER BRETHREN AND OFTEN TOO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERIORS. BUT IF THE EMPERORS HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOT. HERE AND THERE AN ABUSE WAS LOPPED OFF OR AN EDICT WAS PASSED FOR THE VISITATION OF PRISONS AND FOR THE WELFARE OF PRISONERS OR A THEODOSIUS WAS RECALLED TO JUSTICE AND HUMANITY FOR A WHILE BY THE STERN REBUKES OF AN AMBROSE. BUT THE EMPIRE WAS STILL THE SAME STILL A GREAT TYRANNY ENSLAVING THE MASSES CRUSHING NATIONAL LIFE FATTENING ITSELF AND ITS OFFICIALS ON A SYSTEM OF WORLD WIDE ROBBERY AND WHILE IT WAS PARAMOUNT THERE COULD BE NO HOPE FOR THE HUMAN RACE. NAY THERE WERE EVEN THOSE AMONG THE CHRISTIANS WHO SAW LIKE DANTE AFTERWARDS IN THE FATAL GIFT OF CONSTANTINE AND THE TRUCE BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE EMPIRE FRESH AND MORE DEADLY DANGER. WAS NOT THE EMPIRE TRYING TO EXTEND OVER THE CHURCH ITSELF THAT UPAS SHADOW WITH WHICH IT HAD WITHERED UP EVERY OTHER FORM OF HUMAN EXISTENCE TO MAKE HER TOO ITS STIPENDIARY SLAVE OFFICIAL TO BE PAMPERED WHEN OBEDIENT AND SCOURGED WHENEVER SHE DARE ASSERT A FREE WILL OF HER OWN A LAW BEYOND THAT OF HER TYRANTS TO THROW ON HER BY A REFINED HYPOCRISY THE CARE AND SUPPORT OF THE MASSES ON WHOSE LIFEBLOOD IT WAS FEEDING. SO THOUGHT MANY THEN AND AS I BELIEVE NOT UNWISELY. BUT IF THE SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE CIVILISED WORLD WAS ANOMALOUS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH CENTURY ITS SPIRITUAL STATE WAS STILL MORE SO. THE UNIVERSAL FUSION OF RACES LANGUAGES AND CUSTOMS WHICH HAD GONE ON FOR FOUR CENTURIES UNDER THE ROMAN RULE HAD PRODUCED A CORRESPONDING FUSION OF CREEDS AN UNIVERSAL FERMENTATION OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND FAITH. ALL HONEST BELIEF IN THE OLD LOCAL SUPERSTITIONS OF PAGANISM HAD BEEN LONG DYING OUT BEFORE THE MORE PALPABLE AND MATERIAL IDOLATRY OF EMPEROR WORSHIP AND THE GODS OF THE NATIONS UNABLE TO DELIVER THOSE WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THEM BECAME ONE BY ONE THE VASSALS OF THE DIVUS CAESAR NEGLECTED BY THE PHILOSOPHIC RICH AND ONLY WORSHIPPED BY THE LOWER CLASSES WHERE THE OLD RITES STILL PANDERED TO THEIR GROSSER APPETITES OR SUBSERVED THE WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE OF SOME PARTICULAR LOCALITY. IN THE MEANWHILE THE MINDS OF MEN CUT ADRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WANDERED WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL AND CONTEMPLATIVE EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSAND SCHISMS HERESIES AND THEOSOPHIES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE WORD PHILOSOPHY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR FANTASIES. YET EVEN THESE LIKE EVERY OUTBURST OF FREE HUMAN THOUGHT HAD THEIR USE AND THEIR FRUIT. THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCHMEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RELINQUISH FOR EVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATISFIER OF THE HUMAN SOUL. BUT THE HEALTH OF A CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CREED WHICH IT PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VIRTUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS. THE MENS SANA MUST HAVE A CORPUS SANUM TO INHABIT
