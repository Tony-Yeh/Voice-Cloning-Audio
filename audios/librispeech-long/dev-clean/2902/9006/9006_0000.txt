ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ERA LABOURS UNDER A TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE. HE DARE NOT TELL HOW EVIL PEOPLE WERE HE WILL NOT BE BELIEVED IF HE TELLS HOW GOOD THEY WERE. IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HEINOUS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH'S CASE FAR MORE WEAKLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE. NOT BE IT EVER REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IMMORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS OF HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES. HOWSOEVER BASE AND PROFLIGATE THEIR DISCIPLES OR THE MANICHEES MAY HAVE BEEN THE GREAT NEO PLATONISTS WERE AS MANES HIMSELF WAS PERSONS OF THE MOST RIGID AND ASCETIC VIRTUE. FOR A TIME HAD ARRIVED IN WHICH NO TEACHER WHO DID NOT PUT FORTH THE MOST LOFTY PRETENSIONS TO RIGHTEOUSNESS COULD EXPECT A HEARING. THAT DIVINE WORD WHO IS THE LIGHT WHO LIGHTETH EVERY MAN WHICH COMETH INTO THE WORLD HAD AWAKENED IN THE HEART OF MANKIND A MORAL CRAVING NEVER BEFORE FELT IN ANY STRENGTH EXCEPT BY A FEW ISOLATED PHILOSOPHERS OR PROPHETS. THE SPIRIT HAD BEEN POURED OUT ON ALL FLESH AND FROM ONE END OF THE EMPIRE TO THE OTHER FROM THE SLAVE IN THE MILL TO THE EMPEROR ON HIS THRONE ALL HEARTS WERE EITHER HUNGERING AND THIRSTING AFTER RIGHTEOUSNESS OR LEARNING TO DO HOMAGE TO THOSE WHO DID SO. AND HE WHO EXCITED THE CRAVING WAS ALSO FURNISHING THAT WHICH WOULD SATISFY IT AND WAS TEACHING MANKIND BY A LONG AND PAINFUL EDUCATION TO DISTINGUISH THE TRUTH FROM ITS INNUMERABLE COUNTERFEITS AND TO FIND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE WORLD'S LIFE A GOOD NEWS NOT MERELY FOR THE SELECT FEW BUT FOR ALL MANKIND WITHOUT RESPECT OF RANK OR RACE. FOR SOMEWHAT MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS THE ROMAN EMPIRE AND THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH BORN INTO THE WORLD ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT HAD BEEN DEVELOPING THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AS TWO GREAT RIVAL POWERS IN DEADLY STRUGGLE FOR THE POSSESSION OF THE HUMAN RACE. THIS WAS GENERALLY A REAL BOON TO CONQUERED NATIONS BECAUSE IT SUBSTITUTED A FIXED AND REGULAR SPOLIATION FOR THE FORTUITOUS AND ARBITRARY MISERIES OF SAVAGE WARFARE BUT IT ARRAYED MEANWHILE ON THE SIDE OF THE EMPIRE THE WEALTHIER CITIZENS OF EVERY PROVINCE BY ALLOWING THEM THEIR SHARE IN THE PLUNDER OF THE LABOURING MASSES BELOW THEM. THESE IN THE COUNTRY DISTRICTS WERE UTTERLY ENSLAVED WHILE IN THE CITIES NOMINAL FREEDOM WAS OF LITTLE USE TO MASSES KEPT FROM STARVATION BY THE ALMS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND DRUGGED INTO BRUTISH GOOD HUMOUR BY A VAST SYSTEM OF PUBLIC SPECTACLES IN WHICH THE REALMS OF NATURE AND OF ART WERE RANSACKED TO GLUT THE WONDER LUST AND FEROCITY OF A DEGRADED POPULACE. AGAINST THIS VAST ORGANISATION THE CHURCH HAD BEEN FIGHTING FOR NOW FOUR HUNDRED YEARS ARMED ONLY WITH ITS OWN MIGHTY AND ALL EMBRACING MESSAGE AND WITH THE MANIFESTATION OF A SPIRIT OF PURITY AND VIRTUE OF LOVE AND SELF SACRIFICE WHICH HAD PROVED ITSELF MIGHTIER TO MELT AND WELD TOGETHER THE HEARTS OF MEN THAN ALL THE FORCE AND TERROR ALL THE MECHANICAL ORGANISATION ALL THE SENSUAL BAITS WITH WHICH THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN CONTENDING AGAINST THAT GOSPEL IN WHICH IT HAD RECOGNISED INSTINCTIVELY AND AT FIRST SIGHT ITS INTERNECINE FOE. AND NOW THE CHURCH HAD CONQUERED. THE WEAK THINGS OF THIS WORLD HAD CONFOUNDED THE STRONG. THE VERY EMPERORS HAD ARRAYED THEMSELVES ON HER SIDE
