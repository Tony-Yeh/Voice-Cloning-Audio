NOT ONLY HAPPINESS BUT PROSPERITY. WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES. IN GWYNPLAINE EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE. SOMETIMES HE FELT REGRET. VAGUE MISTS OF CONSCIENCE. WHAT WAS THIS NOTHING. THEIR HAPPINESS WAS COMPLETE SO COMPLETE THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER EVEN POOR. FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE. IT HAPPENED SOMETIMES IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN O FOUR THAT AS NIGHT FELL ON SOME LITTLE VILLAGE ON THE COAST A GREAT HEAVY VAN DRAWN BY A PAIR OF STOUT HORSES MADE ITS ENTRY. THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS. THIS GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX. ON THE ROOF FROM A TUBE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE. THIS MOVING HOUSE WAS ALWAYS VARNISHED AND WASHED AFRESH. IN FRONT ON A LEDGE FASTENED TO THE VAN WITH THE WINDOW FOR A DOOR BEHIND THE HORSES AND BY THE SIDE OF AN OLD MAN WHO HELD THE REINS AND DIRECTED THE TEAM TWO GIPSY WOMEN DRESSED AS GODDESSES SOUNDED THEIR TRUMPETS. THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING. THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATRE. A KIND OF ANIMAL BETWEEN DOG AND WOLF WAS CHAINED UNDER THE VAN THIS WAS HOMO. THE OLD COACHMAN WHO DROVE THE HORSES WAS THE PHILOSOPHER HIMSELF. WHENCE CAME THIS IMPROVEMENT FROM THE MISERABLE HUT TO THE OLYMPIC CARAVAN. FROM THIS GWYNPLAINE HAD BECOME FAMOUS. IT WAS WITH A CORRECT SCENT OF WHAT WOULD SUCCEED AMONGST MEN THAT URSUS HAD SAID TO GWYNPLAINE. THEY MADE YOUR FORTUNE. URSUS IT MAY BE REMEMBERED HAD MADE GWYNPLAINE HIS PUPIL. UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD OF THOUGHT. SO SOON AS THE GROWTH OF THE CHILD HAD RENDERED HIM FITTED FOR IT HE HAD BROUGHT HIM OUT ON THE STAGE THAT IS HE HAD PRODUCED HIM IN FRONT OF THE VAN. THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING. THE PASSERS BY WERE IMMEDIATELY STRUCK WITH WONDER. NEVER HAD ANYTHING BEEN SEEN TO BE COMPARED TO THIS EXTRAORDINARY MIMIC OF LAUGHTER. THEY WERE IGNORANT HOW THE MIRACLE OF INFECTIOUS HILARITY HAD BEEN OBTAINED. SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FETES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE. THANKS TO THIS GREAT ATTRACTION THERE HAD COME INTO THE POOR PURSE OF THE WANDERING GROUP FIRST A RAIN OF FARTHINGS THEN OF HEAVY PENNIES AND FINALLY OF SHILLINGS. THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER. ROLLING DOES NOT ENRICH A STONE BUT IT ENRICHES A CARAVAN AND YEAR BY YEAR FROM CITY TO CITY WITH THE INCREASED GROWTH OF GWYNPLAINE'S PERSON AND OF HIS UGLINESS THE FORTUNE PREDICTED BY URSUS HAD COME. WHAT A GOOD TURN THEY DID YOU THERE MY BOY SAID URSUS. THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SOW SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS. A MYTHOLOGICAL FRONTISPIECE WAS IN THOSE DAYS OF SERVICE TO A CARAVAN OF MOUNTEBANKS. WE ARE A WANDERING TEMPLE SAID URSUS. FOR THESE READ FIBI AND VINOS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION. PHOEBE COOKED VENUS SCRUBBED THE TEMPLE
