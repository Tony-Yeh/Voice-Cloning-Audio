URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE WORE MEN'S JACKETS AND LIKE SAILORS ON BOARD A MAN OF WAR GREAT LOOSE TROUSERS. GWYNPLAINE HAD BESIDES FOR HIS WORK AND FOR HIS FEATS OF STRENGTH ROUND HIS NECK AND OVER HIS SHOULDERS AN ESCLAVINE OF LEATHER HE TOOK CHARGE OF THE HORSES. URSUS AND HOMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER. THE EYE WHICH COULD PENETRATE WITHIN THIS STRUCTURE AND ITS INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS MIGHT HAVE PERCEIVED IN A CORNER FASTENED TO THE PLANKS AND IMMOVABLE ON ITS FOUR WHEELS THE OLD HUT OF URSUS PLACED ON HALF PAY ALLOWED TO RUST AND FROM THENCEFORTH DISPENSED THE LABOUR OF ROLLING AS URSUS WAS RELIEVED FROM THE LABOUR OF DRAWING IT. THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BEDCHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE. IT NOW CONTAINED TWO BEDS. IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER WAS THE KITCHEN. THE ARRANGEMENT OF A VESSEL WAS NOT MORE PRECISE AND CONCISE THAN THAT OF THE INTERIOR OF THE GREEN BOX. EVERYTHING WITHIN IT WAS IN ITS PLACE ARRANGED FORESEEN AND INTENDED. THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER. THESE COMMUNICATED BY OPEN SPACES WITHOUT DOORS. A PIECE OF STUFF FELL OVER THEM AND ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF CONCEALMENT. THE COMPARTMENT BEHIND BELONGED TO THE MEN THE COMPARTMENT IN FRONT TO THE WOMEN THE COMPARTMENT IN THE MIDDLE SEPARATING THE TWO SEXES WAS THE STAGE. THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE ORCHESTRA AND THE PROPERTIES WERE KEPT IN THE KITCHEN. A LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT. URSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES. HE HAD A DIVERSITY OF TALENTS HE WAS CLEVER AT SLEIGHT OF HAND. BESIDES THE VOICES HE IMITATED HE PRODUCED ALL SORTS OF UNEXPECTED THINGS SHOCKS OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS SPONTANEOUS FORMATIONS OF FIGURES OR WORDS AS HE WILLED ON THE PARTITION VANISHING FIGURES IN CHIAROSCURO STRANGE THINGS AMIDST WHICH HE SEEMED TO MEDITATE UNMINDFUL OF THE CROWD WHO MARVELLED AT HIM. ONE DAY GWYNPLAINE SAID TO HIM. FATHER YOU LOOK LIKE A SORCERER AND URSUS REPLIED. THEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM. THE GREEN BOX BUILT ON A CLEAR MODEL OF URSUS'S CONTAINED THIS REFINEMENT OF INGENUITY THAT BETWEEN THE FORE AND HIND WHEELS THE CENTRAL PANEL OF THE LEFT SIDE TURNED ON HINGES BY THE AID OF CHAINS AND PULLEYS AND COULD BE LET DOWN AT WILL LIKE A DRAWBRIDGE. AS IT DROPPED IT SET AT LIBERTY THREE LEGS ON HINGES WHICH SUPPORTED THE PANEL WHEN LET DOWN AND WHICH PLACED THEMSELVES STRAIGHT ON THE GROUND LIKE THE LEGS OF A TABLE AND SUPPORTED IT ABOVE THE EARTH LIKE A PLATFORM. THIS EXPOSED THE STAGE WHICH WAS THUS ENLARGED BY THE PLATFORM IN FRONT. THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITINERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR. IT WAS PERHAPS FOR SOME SUCH PIOUS INVENTION THAT SOLON KICKED OUT THESPIS. FOR ALL THAT THESPIS HAS LASTED MUCH LONGER THAN IS GENERALLY BELIEVED. THE TRAVELLING THEATRE IS STILL IN EXISTENCE. THESPIS WOULD NO MORE HAVE DISOWNED URSUS THAN CONGRIO WOULD HAVE DISOWNED GWYNPLAINE. THIS SYMPHONY IS GREGORIAN HE WOULD EXCLAIM. THE SCENE OF THE GREEN BOX REPRESENTED A LANDSCAPE PAINTED BY URSUS AND AS HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PAINT IT REPRESENTED A CAVERN JUST AS WELL AS A LANDSCAPE. THE CURTAIN WHICH WE CALL DROP NOWADAYS WAS A CHECKED SILK WITH SQUARES OF CONTRASTED COLOURS
