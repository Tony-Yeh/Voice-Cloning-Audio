BY VIRTUE OF THE MYSTERIOUS OPERATION TO WHICH GWYNPLAINE HAD PROBABLY BEEN SUBJECTED IN HIS INFANCY EVERY PART OF HIS FACE CONTRIBUTED TO THAT RICTUS HIS WHOLE PHYSIOGNOMY LED TO THAT RESULT AS A WHEEL CENTRES IN THE NAVE. ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRAVATED IT. ANY ASTONISHMENT WHICH MIGHT SEIZE HIM ANY SUFFERING WHICH HE MIGHT FEEL ANY ANGER WHICH MIGHT TAKE POSSESSION OF HIM ANY PITY WHICH MIGHT MOVE HIM WOULD ONLY INCREASE THIS HILARITY OF HIS MUSCLES. IF HE WEPT HE LAUGHED AND WHATEVER GWYNPLAINE WAS WHATEVER HE WISHED TO BE WHATEVER HE THOUGHT THE MOMENT THAT HE RAISED HIS HEAD THE CROWD IF CROWD THERE WAS HAD BEFORE THEM ONE IMPERSONATION AN OVERWHELMING BURST OF LAUGHTER. IT WAS LIKE A HEAD OF MEDUSA BUT MEDUSA HILARIOUS. ALL FEELING OR THOUGHT IN THE MIND OF THE SPECTATOR WAS SUDDENLY PUT TO FLIGHT BY THE UNEXPECTED APPARITION AND LAUGHTER WAS INEVITABLE. ANTIQUE ART FORMERLY PLACED ON THE OUTSIDES OF THE GREEK THEATRE A JOYOUS BRAZEN FACE CALLED COMEDY. IT LAUGHED AND OCCASIONED LAUGHTER BUT REMAINED PENSIVE. ALL PARODY WHICH BORDERS ON FOLLY ALL IRONY WHICH BORDERS ON WISDOM WERE CONDENSED AND AMALGAMATED IN THAT FACE. THE BURDEN OF CARE OF DISILLUSION ANXIETY AND GRIEF WERE EXPRESSED IN ITS IMPASSIVE COUNTENANCE AND RESULTED IN A LUGUBRIOUS SUM OF MIRTH. ONE CORNER OF THE MOUTH WAS RAISED IN MOCKERY OF THE HUMAN RACE THE OTHER SIDE IN BLASPHEMY OF THE GODS. ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE SAID THAT GWYNPLAINE WAS THAT DARK DEAD MASK OF ANCIENT COMEDY ADJUSTED TO THE BODY OF A LIVING MAN. THAT INFERNAL HEAD OF IMPLACABLE HILARITY HE SUPPORTED ON HIS NECK. WHAT A WEIGHT FOR THE SHOULDERS OF A MAN AN EVERLASTING LAUGH. AN EVERLASTING LAUGH. LET US UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WE WILL EXPLAIN. THE MANICHAEANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL. WE DO NOT ADMIT THAT IT CAN EVER BE UTTERLY POWERLESS. THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT. FOR GWYNPLAINE THE POSTSCRIPT WAS THIS BY THE FORCE OF HIS WILL AND BY CONCENTRATING ALL HIS ATTENTION AND ON CONDITION THAT NO EMOTION SHOULD COME TO DISTRACT AND TURN AWAY THE FIXEDNESS OF HIS EFFORT HE COULD MANAGE TO SUSPEND THE EVERLASTING RICTUS OF HIS FACE AND TO THROW OVER IT A KIND OF TRAGIC VEIL AND THEN THE SPECTATOR LAUGHED NO LONGER HE SHUDDERED. THIS EXERTION GWYNPLAINE SCARCELY EVER MADE. IT WAS A TERRIBLE EFFORT AND AN INSUPPORTABLE TENSION. MOREOVER IT HAPPENED THAT ON THE SLIGHTEST DISTRACTION OR THE SLIGHTEST EMOTION THE LAUGH DRIVEN BACK FOR A MOMENT RETURNED LIKE A TIDE WITH AN IMPULSE WHICH WAS IRRESISTIBLE IN PROPORTION TO THE FORCE OF THE ADVERSE EMOTION. WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WAS EVERLASTING. ON SEEING GWYNPLAINE ALL LAUGHED. WHEN THEY HAD LAUGHED THEY TURNED AWAY THEIR HEADS. WOMEN ESPECIALLY SHRANK FROM HIM WITH HORROR THE MAN WAS FRIGHTFUL. THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY. BESIDES WHEN ONCE THE NOVELTY OF THE LAUGH HAD PASSED OVER GWYNPLAINE WAS INTOLERABLE FOR A WOMAN TO SEE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE
