WHEREIN WE SEE THE FACE OF HIM OF WHOM WE HAVE HITHERTO SEEN ONLY THE ACTS. NATURE HAD BEEN PRODIGAL OF HER KINDNESS TO GWYNPLAINE. SHE HAD BESTOWED ON HIM A MOUTH OPENING TO HIS EARS EARS FOLDING OVER TO HIS EYES A SHAPELESS NOSE TO SUPPORT THE SPECTACLES OF THE GRIMACE MAKER AND A FACE THAT NO ONE COULD LOOK UPON WITHOUT LAUGHING. WE HAVE JUST SAID THAT NATURE HAD LOADED GWYNPLAINE WITH HER GIFTS BUT WAS IT NATURE. HAD SHE NOT BEEN ASSISTED. TWO SLITS FOR EYES A HIATUS FOR A MOUTH A SNUB PROTUBERANCE WITH TWO HOLES FOR NOSTRILS A FLATTENED FACE ALL HAVING FOR THE RESULT AN APPEARANCE OF LAUGHTER IT IS CERTAIN THAT NATURE NEVER PRODUCES SUCH PERFECTION SINGLE HANDED. BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYNONYM OF JOY. SUCH A FACE COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CREATED BY CHANCE IT MUST HAVE RESULTED FROM INTENTION. SUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE. MAN CAN DO NOTHING TO CREATE BEAUTY BUT EVERYTHING TO PRODUCE UGLINESS. A HOTTENTOT PROFILE CANNOT BE CHANGED INTO A ROMAN OUTLINE BUT OUT OF A GRECIAN NOSE YOU MAY MAKE A CALMUCK'S. IT ONLY REQUIRES TO OBLITERATE THE ROOT OF THE NOSE AND TO FLATTEN THE NOSTRILS. THE DOG LATIN OF THE MIDDLE AGES HAD A REASON FOR ITS CREATION OF THE VERB DENASARE. HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT. NEEDED THERE A GREATER MOTIVE THAN THE SPECULATION OF HIS FUTURE EXHIBITION. ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE. IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELLED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMEDITATION. MAN IS NOT BORN THUS. HOWEVER IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE MANIPULATION OF GWYNPLAINE HAD SUCCEEDED ADMIRABLY. GWYNPLAINE WAS A GIFT OF PROVIDENCE TO DISPEL THE SADNESS OF MAN. OF WHAT PROVIDENCE. IS THERE A PROVIDENCE OF DEMONS AS WELL AS OF GOD. WE PUT THE QUESTION WITHOUT ANSWERING IT. GWYNPLAINE WAS A MOUNTEBANK. HE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM. NO SUCH EFFECT HAD EVER BEFORE BEEN PRODUCED. HYPOCHONDRIACS WERE CURED BY THE SIGHT OF HIM ALONE. HE WAS AVOIDED BY FOLKS IN MOURNING BECAUSE THEY WERE COMPELLED TO LAUGH WHEN THEY SAW HIM WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR DECENT GRAVITY. ONE DAY THE EXECUTIONER CAME AND GWYNPLAINE MADE HIM LAUGH. EVERY ONE WHO SAW GWYNPLAINE HELD HIS SIDES HE SPOKE AND THEY ROLLED ON THE GROUND. HE WAS REMOVED FROM SADNESS AS IS POLE FROM POLE. SPLEEN AT THE ONE GWYNPLAINE AT THE OTHER. THUS HE ROSE RAPIDLY IN THE FAIR GROUND AND AT THE CROSS ROADS TO THE VERY SATISFACTORY RENOWN OF A HORRIBLE MAN. IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF. HIS FACE LAUGHED HIS THOUGHTS DID NOT. THE EXTRAORDINARY FACE WHICH CHANCE OR A SPECIAL AND WEIRD INDUSTRY HAD FASHIONED FOR HIM LAUGHED ALONE. GWYNPLAINE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR. THE LAUGH WHICH HE HAD NOT PLACED HIMSELF ON HIS BROW ON HIS EYELIDS ON HIS MOUTH HE COULD NOT REMOVE. IT HAD BEEN STAMPED FOR EVER ON HIS FACE. IT WAS AUTOMATIC AND THE MORE IRRESISTIBLE BECAUSE IT SEEMED PETRIFIED. NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICTUS. TWO CONVULSIONS OF THE FACE ARE INFECTIOUS LAUGHING AND YAWNING
