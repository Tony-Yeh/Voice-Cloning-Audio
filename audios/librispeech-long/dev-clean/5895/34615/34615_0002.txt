BUT HE WAS TALL WELL MADE AND AGILE AND NO WAY DEFORMED EXCEPTING IN HIS FACE. THIS LED TO THE PRESUMPTION THAT GWYNPLAINE WAS RATHER A CREATION OF ART THAN A WORK OF NATURE. GWYNPLAINE BEAUTIFUL IN FIGURE HAD PROBABLY BEEN BEAUTIFUL IN FACE. THEY HAD LEFT THE BODY INTACT AND RETOUCHED ONLY THE FACE. GWYNPLAINE HAD BEEN MADE TO ORDER AT LEAST THAT WAS PROBABLE. THEY HAD LEFT HIM HIS TEETH TEETH ARE NECESSARY TO A LAUGH. THE DEATH'S HEAD RETAINS THEM. THE OPERATION PERFORMED ON HIM MUST HAVE BEEN FRIGHTFUL. SURGICAL SCULPTURE OF THE KIND COULD NEVER HAVE SUCCEEDED EXCEPT ON A VERY YOUNG CHILD AND CONSEQUENTLY ON ONE HAVING LITTLE CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHO MIGHT EASILY TAKE A WOUND FOR A SICKNESS.

THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD. THE FACIAL ANGLE WAS POWERFUL AND SURPRISINGLY GRAND. BEHIND HIS LAUGH THERE WAS A SOUL DREAMING AS ALL OUR SOULS DREAM. HOWEVER HIS LAUGH WAS TO GWYNPLAINE QUITE A TALENT. HE COULD DO NOTHING WITH IT SO HE TURNED IT TO ACCOUNT. BY MEANS OF IT HE GAINED HIS LIVING
