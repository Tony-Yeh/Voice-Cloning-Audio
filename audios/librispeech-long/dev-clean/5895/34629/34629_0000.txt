THE GREEN BOX AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN HAD ARRIVED IN LONDON. IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTHWARK. URSUS HAD BEEN TEMPTED BY THE BOWLING GREEN WHICH HAD ONE GREAT RECOMMENDATION THAT IT WAS ALWAYS FAIR DAY THERE EVEN IN WINTER. THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHT TO URSUS. LONDON TAKE IT ALL IN ALL HAS SOME GOOD IN IT. IT WAS A BRAVE THING TO DEDICATE A CATHEDRAL TO SAINT PAUL. THE REAL CATHEDRAL SAINT IS SAINT PETER. SAINT PAUL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES. HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTISTS DOOR. A CATHEDRAL IS A SIGN. SAINT PETER IS THE SIGN OF ROME THE CITY OF THE DOGMA SAINT PAUL THAT OF LONDON THE CITY OF SCHISM. URSUS WHOSE PHILOSOPHY HAD ARMS SO LONG THAT IT EMBRACED EVERYTHING WAS A MAN WHO APPRECIATED THESE SHADES OF DIFFERENCE AND HIS ATTRACTION TOWARDS LONDON AROSE PERHAPS FROM A CERTAIN TASTE OF HIS FOR SAINT PAUL. THE YARD OF THE TADCASTER INN HAD TAKEN THE FANCY OF URSUS. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOX. IT WAS A THEATRE READY MADE. AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE. A LARGE WOODEN BALCONY ROOFED OVER AND SUPPORTED ON POSTS ON WHICH THE ROOMS OF THE FIRST STORY OPENED RAN ROUND THE THREE FRONTS OF THE INTERIOR FACADE OF THE HOUSE MAKING TWO RIGHT ANGLES. THE WINDOWS OF THE GROUND FLOOR MADE BOXES THE PAVEMENT OF THE COURT THE PIT AND THE BALCONY THE GALLERY. THE GREEN BOX REARED AGAINST THE WALL WAS THUS IN FRONT OF A THEATRE. IT WAS VERY LIKE THE GLOBE WHERE THEY PLAYED OTHELLO KING LEAR AND THE TEMPEST. IN A CORNER BEHIND THE GREEN BOX WAS A STABLE. URSUS HAD MADE HIS ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE TAVERN KEEPER MASTER NICLESS WHO OWING TO HIS RESPECT FOR THE LAW WOULD NOT ADMIT THE WOLF WITHOUT CHARGING HIM EXTRA. THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN. THE SITTING ROOM OF THE TAVERN HAD AS WE HAVE SEEN AN INSIDE DOOR WHICH OPENED INTO THE COURT. BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES FIBI AND SOMETIMES VINOS. THIS WAS MANAGED MUCH AS AT PRESENT PAY AND PASS IN. UNDER THE PLACARD ANNOUNCING THE LAUGHING MAN WAS A PIECE OF WOOD PAINTED WHITE HUNG ON TWO NAILS ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN CHARCOAL IN LARGE LETTERS THE TITLE OF URSUS'S GRAND PIECE CHAOS VANQUISHED. IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD IN TWO ROWS TEN SPECTATORS. WE ARE IN LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY. HE HAD FURNISHED THIS BOX WITH THE BEST CHAIRS IN THE INN AND HAD PLACED IN THE CENTRE A GRAND ARM CHAIR OF YELLOW UTRECHT VELVET WITH A CHERRY COLOURED PATTERN IN CASE SOME ALDERMAN'S WIFE SHOULD COME. THEY BEGAN THEIR PERFORMANCES. THE CROWD IMMEDIATELY FLOCKED TO THEM BUT THE COMPARTMENT FOR THE NOBILITY REMAINED EMPTY. WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTEBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL. ALL SOUTHWARK RAN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MAN. THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TARRINZEAU FIELD WERE AGHAST AT GWYNPLAINE. THE EFFECT HE CAUSED WAS AS THAT OF A SPARROW HAWK FLAPPING HIS WINGS IN A CAGE OF GOLDFINCHES AND FEEDING IN THEIR SEED TROUGH. GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THEIR PUBLIC. BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWORDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN. THERE WAS A TRAVELLING MENAGERIE WHERE WAS TO BE SEEN A PERFORMING TIGER WHO LASHED BY THE KEEPER SNAPPED AT THE WHIP AND TRIED TO SWALLOW THE LASH. EVEN THIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
