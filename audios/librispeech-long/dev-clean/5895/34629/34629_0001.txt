CURIOSITY APPLAUSE RECEIPTS CROWDS THE LAUGHING MAN MONOPOLIZED EVERYTHING. IT HAPPENED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE. NOTHING WAS THOUGHT OF BUT THE GREEN BOX. CHAOS VANQUISHED IS CHAOS VICTOR SAID URSUS APPROPRIATING HALF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS AND TAKING THE WIND OUT OF HIS SAILS AS THEY SAY AT SEA. THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL. FAME DOES NOT CROSS THE SEA EASILY. IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE. THE SEA IS A WALL AND IF VOLTAIRE A THING WHICH HE VERY MUCH REGRETTED WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE HAD NOT THROWN A BRIDGE OVER TO SHAKESPEARE SHAKESPEARE MIGHT STILL BE IN ENGLAND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL A CAPTIVE IN INSULAR GLORY. THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE. IT WAS NOT GREAT ENOUGH YET TO RE ECHO THROUGHOUT THE CITY AT LEAST NOT AT FIRST. BUT SOUTHWARK OUGHT TO HAVE SUFFICED TO SATISFY THE AMBITION OF A CLOWN URSUS SAID. THE MONEY BAG GROWS PALPABLY BIGGER. THEY PLAYED URSUS RURSUS AND CHAOS VANQUISHED. BETWEEN THE ACTS URSUS EXHIBITED HIS POWER AS AN ENGASTRIMIST AND EXECUTED MARVELS OF VENTRILOQUISM. THESE WERE REMARKABLE TALENTS. BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK. SOUTHWARK WAS ENTHRALLED. URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED. AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE. IT WAS COMPOSED OF WATERMEN CHAIRMEN COACHMEN AND BARGEMEN AND SAILORS JUST ASHORE SPENDING THEIR WAGES IN FEASTING AND WOMEN. IN IT THERE WERE FELONS RUFFIANS AND BLACKGUARDS WHO WERE SOLDIERS CONDEMNED FOR SOME CRIME AGAINST DISCIPLINE TO WEAR THEIR RED COATS WHICH WERE LINED WITH BLACK INSIDE OUT AND FROM THENCE THE NAME OF BLACKGUARD WHICH THE FRENCH TURN INTO BLAGUEURS. ALL THESE FLOWED FROM THE STREET INTO THE THEATRE AND POURED BACK FROM THE THEATRE INTO THE TAP. THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS. AMIDST WHAT IT IS USUAL TO CALL THE SCUM THERE WAS ONE TALLER THAN THE REST BIGGER STRONGER LESS POVERTY STRICKEN BROADER IN THE SHOULDERS DRESSED LIKE THE COMMON PEOPLE BUT NOT RAGGED. ADMIRING AND APPLAUDING EVERYTHING TO THE SKIES CLEARING HIS WAY WITH HIS FISTS WEARING A DISORDERED PERIWIG SWEARING SHOUTING JOKING NEVER DIRTY AND AT NEED READY TO BLACKEN AN EYE OR PAY FOR A BOTTLE. THIS CONNOISSEUR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN. HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM. WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS. HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM. THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR. URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE WANTED TO KNOW HIM AT LEAST TO KNOW WHO HE WAS. ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NICLESS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM. DO YOU KNOW THAT MAN OF COURSE I DO. WHO IS HE A SAILOR. WHAT IS HIS NAME SAID GWYNPLAINE INTERRUPTING. TOM JIM JACK REPLIED THE INN KEEPER
