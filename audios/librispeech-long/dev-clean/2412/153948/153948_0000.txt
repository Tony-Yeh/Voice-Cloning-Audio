IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF. SUFFICE IT THAT WHEN I LEFT HOME IT WAS WITH THE INTENTION OF GOING TO SOME NEW COLONY AND EITHER FINDING OR EVEN PERHAPS PURCHASING WASTE CROWN LAND SUITABLE FOR CATTLE OR SHEEP FARMING BY WHICH MEANS I THOUGHT THAT I COULD BETTER MY FORTUNES MORE RAPIDLY THAN IN ENGLAND. IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE. BUT TO THIS END I MUST POSSESS MYSELF OF A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY NEITHER DO I KNOW HOW TO GET IT EXCEPT BY INTERESTING THE PUBLIC IN MY STORY AND INDUCING THE CHARITABLE TO COME FORWARD AND ASSIST ME. WITH THIS HOPE I NOW PUBLISH MY ADVENTURES BUT I DO SO WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE FOR I FEAR THAT MY STORY WILL BE DOUBTED UNLESS I TELL THE WHOLE OF IT AND YET I DARE NOT DO SO LEST OTHERS WITH MORE MEANS THAN MINE SHOULD GET THE START OF ME. I PREFER THE RISK OF BEING DOUBTED TO THAT OF BEING ANTICIPATED AND HAVE THEREFORE CONCEALED MY DESTINATION ON LEAVING ENGLAND AS ALSO THE POINT FROM WHICH I BEGAN MY MORE SERIOUS AND DIFFICULT JOURNEY. MY CHIEF CONSOLATION LIES IN THE FACT THAT TRUTH BEARS ITS OWN IMPRESS AND THAT MY STORY WILL CARRY CONVICTION BY REASON OF THE INTERNAL EVIDENCES FOR ITS ACCURACY. NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST WILL DOUBT MY BEING SO. I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HEMISPHERE I WAS. THE COLONY WAS ONE WHICH HAD NOT BEEN OPENED UP EVEN TO THE MOST ADVENTUROUS SETTLERS FOR MORE THAN EIGHT OR NINE YEARS HAVING BEEN PREVIOUSLY UNINHABITED SAVE BY A FEW TRIBES OF SAVAGES WHO FREQUENTED THE SEABOARD. THE COAST WAS PERFECTLY WELL KNOWN BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE TRACT TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED BUT IN NEITHER DIRECTION WAS THERE A SINGLE HARBOUR FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILES AND THE MOUNTAINS WHICH DESCENDED ALMOST INTO THE SEA WERE COVERED WITH THICK TIMBER SO THAT NONE WOULD THINK OF SETTLING. THE CLIMATE WAS TEMPERATE AND VERY HEALTHY THERE WERE NO WILD ANIMALS NOR WERE THE NATIVES DANGEROUS BEING FEW IN NUMBER AND OF AN INTELLIGENT TRACTABLE DISPOSITION. SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BRED WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACRE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED ABOUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY. MEN PUSHED FARTHER AND FARTHER INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND FOUND A VERY CONSIDERABLE TRACT INSIDE THE FRONT RANGE BETWEEN IT AND ANOTHER WHICH WAS LOFTIER STILL THOUGH EVEN THIS WAS NOT THE HIGHEST THE GREAT SNOWY ONE WHICH COULD BE SEEN FROM OUT UPON THE PLAINS. THIS SECOND RANGE HOWEVER SEEMED TO MARK THE EXTREME LIMITS OF PASTORAL COUNTRY AND IT WAS HERE AT A SMALL AND NEWLY FOUNDED STATION THAT I WAS RECEIVED AS A CADET AND SOON REGULARLY EMPLOYED. I WAS THEN JUST TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD. I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE. IT WAS MY DAILY BUSINESS TO GO UP TO THE TOP OF A CERTAIN HIGH MOUNTAIN AND DOWN ONE OF ITS SPURS ON TO THE FLAT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT NO SHEEP HAD CROSSED THEIR BOUNDARIES. I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING EWES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET. THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK EWES AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM. IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED. I HAD A TELESCOPE AND A DOG AND WOULD TAKE BREAD AND MEAT AND TOBACCO WITH ME
