STARTING WITH EARLY DAWN IT WOULD BE NIGHT BEFORE I COULD COMPLETE MY ROUND FOR THE MOUNTAIN OVER WHICH I HAD TO GO WAS VERY HIGH. IN WINTER IT WAS COVERED WITH SNOW AND THE SHEEP NEEDED NO WATCHING FROM ABOVE. IT WAS A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL. THE COUNTRY WAS THE GRANDEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED. BEYOND THE DOWNS WAS A PLAIN GOING DOWN TO A RIVER OF GREAT SIZE ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF WHICH THERE WERE OTHER HIGH MOUNTAINS WITH THE WINTER'S SNOW STILL NOT QUITE MELTED UP THE RIVER WHICH RAN WINDING IN MANY STREAMS OVER A BED SOME TWO MILES BROAD I LOOKED UPON THE SECOND GREAT CHAIN AND COULD SEE A NARROW GORGE WHERE THE RIVER RETIRED AND WAS LOST. SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMB BLEATING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING. THEN THERE COMES SOME LEAN AND WITHERED OLD EWE WITH DEEP GRUFF VOICE AND UNLOVELY ASPECT TROTTING BACK FROM THE SEDUCTIVE PASTURE NOW SHE EXAMINES THIS GULLY AND NOW THAT AND NOW SHE STANDS LISTENING WITH UPLIFTED HEAD THAT SHE MAY HEAR THE DISTANT WAILING AND OBEY IT. AHA THEY SEE AND RUSH TOWARDS EACH OTHER. ALAS THEY ARE BOTH MISTAKEN THE EWE IS NOT THE LAMB'S EWE THEY ARE NEITHER KIN NOR KIND TO ONE ANOTHER AND PART IN COLDNESS. EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL. BUT THIS IS MERE DREAMING AND I MUST PROCEED. I COULD NOT HELP SPECULATING UPON WHAT MIGHT LIE FARTHER UP THE RIVER AND BEHIND THE SECOND RANGE. I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BORROWED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN. TRUE THE RANGE LOOKED SO VAST THAT THERE SEEMED LITTLE CHANCE OF GETTING A SUFFICIENT ROAD THROUGH IT OR OVER IT BUT NO ONE HAD YET EXPLORED IT AND IT IS WONDERFUL HOW ONE FINDS THAT ONE CAN MAKE A PATH INTO ALL SORTS OF PLACES AND EVEN GET A ROAD FOR PACK HORSES WHICH FROM A DISTANCE APPEAR INACCESSIBLE THE RIVER WAS SO GREAT THAT IT MUST DRAIN AN INNER TRACT AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO AND THOUGH EVERY ONE SAID IT WOULD BE MADNESS TO ATTEMPT TAKING SHEEP FARTHER INLAND I KNEW THAT ONLY THREE YEARS AGO THE SAME CRY HAD BEEN RAISED AGAINST THE COUNTRY WHICH MY MASTER'S FLOCK WAS NOW OVERRUNNING. BUT OVER AND ABOVE THESE THOUGHTS CAME THAT OF THE GREAT RANGE ITSELF. WHAT WAS BEYOND IT AH WHO COULD SAY. THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS IT. THIS WOULD BE THE HIGHEST TRIUMPH THAT I COULD WISH FOR BUT IT WAS TOO MUCH TO THINK OF YET. I WOULD TRY THE NEARER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO. EVEN IF I DID NOT FIND COUNTRY MIGHT I NOT FIND GOLD OR DIAMONDS OR COPPER OR SILVER. I WOULD SOMETIMES LIE FLAT DOWN TO DRINK OUT OF A STREAM AND COULD SEE LITTLE YELLOW SPECKS AMONG THE SAND WERE THESE GOLD. PEOPLE SAID NO BUT THEN PEOPLE ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS NO GOLD UNTIL IT WAS FOUND TO BE ABUNDANT THERE WAS PLENTY OF SLATE AND GRANITE WHICH I HAD ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD TO ACCOMPANY GOLD AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT FOUND IN PAYING QUANTITIES HERE IT MIGHT BE ABUNDANT IN THE MAIN RANGES
