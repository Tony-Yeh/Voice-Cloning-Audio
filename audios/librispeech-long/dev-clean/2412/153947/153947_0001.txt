I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO. AS REGARDS ITS REJECTION BY MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL I BELIEVE THEIR READER ADVISED THEM QUITE WISELY. I HOPE THAT IF I HAD BEEN THEIR READER AND THE BOOK HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO MYSELF I SHOULD HAVE ADVISED THEM TO THE SAME EFFECT. EREWHON APPEARED WITH THE LAST DAY OR TWO OF MARCH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO. I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVOURABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH. THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE. I WAS COMPLAINING ONCE TO A FRIEND THAT THOUGH EREWHON HAD MET WITH SUCH A WARM RECEPTION MY SUBSEQUENT BOOKS HAD BEEN ALL OF THEM PRACTICALLY STILL BORN. HE SAID YOU FORGET ONE CHARM THAT EREWHON HAD BUT WHICH NONE OF YOUR OTHER BOOKS CAN HAVE. I ASKED WHAT AND WAS ANSWERED THE SOUND OF A NEW VOICE AND OF AN UNKNOWN VOICE. THE FIRST EDITION OF EREWHON SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOULDS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY. I MADE A FEW UNIMPORTANT ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS AND ADDED A PREFACE OF WHICH I CANNOT SAY THAT I AM PARTICULARLY PROUD BUT AN INEXPERIENCED WRITER WITH A HEAD SOMEWHAT TURNED BY UNEXPECTED SUCCESS IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED WITH A PREFACE. I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOULDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THEN MADE. HAVING NOW I FEAR AT TOO GREAT LENGTH DONE WHAT I WAS ASKED TO DO I SHOULD LIKE TO ADD A FEW WORDS ON MY OWN ACCOUNT. I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EREWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD. THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPYRIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS. IT WAS NECESSARY THEREFORE TO REVISE THE BOOK THROUGHOUT FOR LITERARY INELEGANCIES OF WHICH I FOUND MANY MORE THAN I HAD EXPECTED AND ALSO TO MAKE SUCH SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONS AS SHOULD SECURE A NEW LEASE OF LIFE AT ANY RATE FOR THE COPYRIGHT. IF THEN INSTEAD OF CUTTING OUT SAY FIFTY PAGES I HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO ADD ABOUT SIXTY INVITA MINERVA THE BLAME RESTS NEITHER WITH MY PUBLISHER NOR WITH ME BUT WITH THE COPYRIGHT LAWS. IN EREWHON THERE WAS HARDLY ANY STORY AND LITTLE ATTEMPT TO GIVE LIFE AND INDIVIDUALITY TO THE CHARACTERS I HOPE THAT IN EREWHON REVISITED BOTH THESE DEFECTS HAVE BEEN IN GREAT MEASURE AVOIDED. EREWHON WAS NOT AN ORGANIC WHOLE EREWHON REVISITED MAY FAIRLY CLAIM TO BE ONE
