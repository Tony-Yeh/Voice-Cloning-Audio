THE AUTHOR WISHES IT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT EREWHON IS PRONOUNCED AS A WORD OF THREE SYLLABLES ALL SHORT THUS E RE WHON. PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE. A FRIEND HAVING CALLED MY ATTENTION TO ONE OF THE FIRST OF THESE ADVERTISEMENTS AND SUGGESTING THAT IT PROBABLY REFERRED TO A WORK OF SIMILAR CHARACTER TO MY OWN I TOOK EREWHON TO A WELL KNOWN FIRM OF PUBLISHERS ON THE FIRST OF MAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND LEFT IT IN THEIR HANDS FOR CONSIDERATION. ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER. THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER. I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM MY INTENTION AND FEW THINGS WOULD BE MORE DISTASTEFUL TO ME THAN ANY ATTEMPT TO LAUGH AT MISTER DARWIN BUT I MUST OWN THAT I HAVE MYSELF TO THANK FOR THE MISCONCEPTION FOR I FELT SURE THAT MY INTENTION WOULD BE MISSED BUT PREFERRED NOT TO WEAKEN THE CHAPTERS BY EXPLANATION AND KNEW VERY WELL THAT MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY WOULD TAKE NO HARM. THE ONLY QUESTION IN MY MIND WAS HOW FAR I COULD AFFORD TO BE MISREPRESENTED AS LAUGHING AT THAT FOR WHICH I HAVE THE MOST PROFOUND ADMIRATION. I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE. HE WHO DOES THIS IS AN ENEMY WHO DESERVES NO QUARTER. I SHOULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT I HAD BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EXPLICIT BUT HAVE MADE A FEW ADDITIONS TO THE CHAPTER ON MALCONTENTS WHICH WILL I THINK SERVE TO RENDER FURTHER MISTAKE IMPOSSIBLE. THE ART OF WRITING THINGS THAT SHALL SOUND RIGHT AND YET BE WRONG HAS MADE SO MANY REPUTATIONS AND AFFORDS COMFORT TO SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF READERS THAT I COULD NOT VENTURE TO NEGLECT IT THE LATIN GRAMMAR HOWEVER IS A SUBJECT ON WHICH SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY FEEL STRONGLY SO I HAVE NOW WRITTEN AGRICOLAS. I HAVE ALSO PARTED WITH THE WORD INFORTUNIAM THOUGH NOT WITHOUT REGRET BUT HAVE NOT DARED TO MEDDLE WITH OTHER SIMILAR INACCURACIES. BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER. I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES. JUNE NINTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO. PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION. I THEREFORE PLACE ON RECORD AS MUCH AS I CAN REMEMBER ON THIS HEAD AFTER A LAPSE OF MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS. IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RANGITATA DISTRICT OF THE CANTERBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRISTCHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE. A COPY OF THIS ARTICLE IS INDEXED UNDER MY BOOKS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM CATALOGUE. A SECOND ARTICLE ON THE SAME SUBJECT AS THE ONE JUST REFERRED TO APPEARED IN THE PRESS SHORTLY AFTER THE FIRST BUT I HAVE NO COPY. I AGAIN REWROTE AND ENLARGED IT TILL IT ASSUMED THE FORM IN WHICH IT APPEARED IN THE FIRST EDITION OF EREWHON. THE NEXT PART OF EREWHON THAT I WROTE WAS THE WORLD OF THE UNBORN A PRELIMINARY FORM OF WHICH WAS SENT TO MISTER HOLYOAKE'S PAPER BUT AS I CANNOT FIND IT AMONG THOSE COPIES OF THE REASONER THAT ARE IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM I CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS NOT ACCEPTED. I ALSO WROTE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION. THESE FOUR DETACHED PAPERS WERE I BELIEVE ALL THAT WAS WRITTEN OF EREWHON BEFORE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY
