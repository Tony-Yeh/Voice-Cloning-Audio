IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER. SUFFICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME. IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPITE OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT. THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM. BOTH OF THEM APPEARED ASTONISHED AT SEEING ONE WHO WAS EVIDENTLY A STRANGER BUT THEY WERE TOO ILL TO COME UP TO ME AND FORM CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING ME. THESE TWO WERE FIRST CALLED OUT AND IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR I WAS MADE TO FOLLOW THEM WHICH I DID IN SOME FEAR AND WITH MUCH CURIOSITY. THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE WAS A VENERABLE LOOKING MAN WITH WHITE HAIR AND BEARD AND A FACE OF GREAT SAGACITY. HE LOOKED ME ALL OVER FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LETTING HIS EYES WANDER FROM THE CROWN OF MY HEAD TO THE SOLES OF MY FEET UP AND DOWN AND DOWN AND UP NEITHER DID HIS MIND SEEM IN THE LEAST CLEARER WHEN HE HAD DONE LOOKING THAN WHEN HE BEGAN. HE AT LENGTH ASKED ME A SINGLE SHORT QUESTION WHICH I SUPPOSED MEANT WHO ARE YOU. THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONGUE THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT. AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED THEY PROCEEDED TO OVERHAUL MY SWAG AND THE CONTENTS OF MY POCKETS. THIS GAVE ME LITTLE UNEASINESS FOR I HAD NO MONEY WITH ME NOR ANYTHING WHICH THEY WERE AT ALL LIKELY TO WANT OR WHICH I CARED ABOUT LOSING. AT LEAST I FANCIED SO BUT I SOON FOUND MY MISTAKE. THEY GOT ON COMFORTABLY AT FIRST THOUGH THEY WERE MUCH PUZZLED WITH MY TOBACCO PIPE AND INSISTED ON SEEING ME USE IT. WHEN I HAD SHOWN THEM WHAT I DID WITH IT THEY WERE ASTONISHED BUT NOT DISPLEASED AND SEEMED TO LIKE THE SMELL. BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH. THEY SEEMED CONCERNED AND UNEASY AS SOON AS THEY GOT HOLD OF IT. I REMEMBER THAT WHEN THEY FIRST FOUND IT I HAD THOUGHT OF PALEY AND HOW HE TELLS US THAT A SAVAGE ON SEEING A WATCH WOULD AT ONCE CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS DESIGNED. HE SPOKE TO ME SOLEMNLY AND STERNLY FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES. THEN REFLECTING THAT THIS WAS OF NO USE HE CAUSED ME TO BE CONDUCTED THROUGH SEVERAL PASSAGES INTO A LARGE ROOM WHICH I AFTERWARDS FOUND WAS THE MUSEUM OF THE TOWN AND WHEREIN I BEHELD A SIGHT WHICH ASTONISHED ME MORE THAN ANYTHING THAT I HAD YET SEEN. IT WAS FILLED WITH CASES CONTAINING ALL MANNER OF CURIOSITIES SUCH AS SKELETONS STUFFED BIRDS AND ANIMALS CARVINGS IN STONE WHEREOF I SAW SEVERAL THAT WERE LIKE THOSE ON THE SADDLE ONLY SMALLER BUT THE GREATER PART OF THE ROOM WAS OCCUPIED BY BROKEN MACHINERY OF ALL DESCRIPTIONS. THE LARGER SPECIMENS HAD A CASE TO THEMSELVES AND TICKETS WITH WRITING ON THEM IN A CHARACTER WHICH I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND. THERE WERE FRAGMENTS OF STEAM ENGINES ALL BROKEN AND RUSTED AMONG THEM I SAW A CYLINDER AND PISTON A BROKEN FLY WHEEL AND PART OF A CRANK WHICH WAS LAID ON THE GROUND BY THEIR SIDE. AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON RAILS. INDEED THERE WERE FRAGMENTS OF A GREAT MANY OF OUR OWN MOST ADVANCED INVENTIONS BUT THEY SEEMED ALL TO BE SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND TO BE PLACED WHERE THEY WERE NOT FOR INSTRUCTION BUT CURIOSITY. AS I SAID BEFORE ALL WERE MARRED AND BROKEN. WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES. HERE THE MAGISTRATE STOPPED AND OPENING THE CASE BEGAN COMPARING MY WATCH WITH THE OTHERS. THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME. THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM
