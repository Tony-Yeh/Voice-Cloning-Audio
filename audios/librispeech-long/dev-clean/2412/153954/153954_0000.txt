WE FOLLOWED AN ALPINE PATH FOR SOME FOUR MILES NOW HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE A BRAWLING STREAM WHICH DESCENDED FROM THE GLACIERS AND NOW NEARLY ALONGSIDE IT. THE MORNING WAS COLD AND SOMEWHAT FOGGY FOR THE AUTUMN HAD MADE GREAT STRIDES LATTERLY. HOWEVER I SHOWED NO SIGN OF WONDER OR DISAPPROVAL FOR I REMEMBERED THAT TO BE ALL THINGS TO ALL MEN WAS ONE OF THE INJUNCTIONS OF THE GENTILE APOSTLE WHICH FOR THE PRESENT I SHOULD DO WELL TO HEED. SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE. BUT IT WAS NOT SO. MY GUIDES SPOKE TO MANY IN PASSING AND THOSE SPOKEN TO SHOWED MUCH AMAZEMENT. MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR I THEM. I MAY AS WELL SAY AT ONCE WHAT MY AFTER EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME NAMELY THAT WITH ALL THEIR FAULTS AND EXTRAORDINARY OBLIQUITY OF MENTAL VISION UPON MANY SUBJECTS THEY ARE THE VERY BEST BRED PEOPLE THAT I EVER FELL IN WITH. THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN. THE VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME. EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGETATED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST. IT WAS HERE AS HITHERTO ALL THINGS WERE GENERICALLY THE SAME AS IN EUROPE THE DIFFERENCES BEING OF SPECIES ONLY AND I WAS AMUSED AT SEEING IN A WINDOW SOME BOTTLES WITH BARLEY SUGAR AND SWEETMEATS FOR CHILDREN AS AT HOME BUT THE BARLEY SUGAR WAS IN PLATES NOT IN TWISTED STICKS AND WAS COLOURED BLUE. GLASS WAS PLENTIFUL IN THE BETTER HOUSES. LASTLY I SHOULD SAY THAT THE PEOPLE WERE OF A PHYSICAL BEAUTY WHICH WAS SIMPLY AMAZING. I NEVER SAW ANYTHING IN THE LEAST COMPARABLE TO THEM. THE WOMEN WERE VIGOROUS AND HAD A MOST MAJESTIC GAIT THEIR HEADS BEING SET UPON THEIR SHOULDERS WITH A GRACE BEYOND ALL POWER OF EXPRESSION. EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT. THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION IN FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY. I WAS DAZZLED AS I SAW ONE AFTER THE OTHER OF WHOM I COULD ONLY FEEL THAT EACH WAS THE LOVELIEST I HAD EVER SEEN. EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GREY HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN. THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN BEAUTIFUL. I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGYPTIAN GREEK AND ITALIAN. THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY. I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED. I SHOULD ADD THAT ALL SEEMED TO TAKE A PRIDE IN THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND THAT EVEN THE POOREST AND NONE SEEMED RICH WERE WELL KEMPT AND TIDY. I COULD FILL MANY PAGES WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THEIR DRESS AND THE ORNAMENTS WHICH THEY WORE AND A HUNDRED DETAILS WHICH STRUCK ME WITH ALL THE FORCE OF NOVELTY BUT I MUST NOT STAY TO DO SO. WHEN WE HAD GOT PAST THE VILLAGE THE FOG ROSE AND REVEALED MAGNIFICENT VIEWS OF THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS AND THEIR NEARER ABUTMENTS WHILE IN FRONT I COULD NOW AND AGAIN CATCH GLIMPSES OF THE GREAT PLAINS WHICH I HAD SURVEYED ON THE PRECEDING EVENING. THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING. I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS. DOGS WERE THERE IN PLENTY AND VERY ENGLISH BUT I SAW NO CATS NOR INDEED ARE THESE CREATURES KNOWN THEIR PLACE BEING SUPPLIED BY A SORT OF SMALL TERRIER
