ULYSSES SIMPSON GRANT. WHEN A MAN IS ENERGETIC AND DETERMINES TO BE SOMEBODY IN THE WORLD WHICH IS PRAISEWORTHY SO LONG AS THAT ENERGY IS GUIDED BY PROPRIETY AND A JUST CONCEPTION OF RIGHT THERE ARE ALWAYS SCORES HUNDREDS PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ENDEAVOR TO DEPRECIATE THAT MAN'S REWARD. NO OTHER EXCUSE CAN BE ASSIGNED FOR THE SLANDER AND VITUPERATION WHICH HAS FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN HEAPED UPON THE FAIR REPUTATION OF GENERAL U S GRANT. BORN IN OBSCURITY AT POINT PLEASANT OHIO APRIL TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO HIS LIFE IS A FITTING TYPE OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF OUR GLORIOUS INSTITUTIONS. THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF HON THOMAS L HAMER HE WAS ADMITTED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE. PERSONALLY AT THIS EARLY AGE HE DETESTED WAR AND WAS OPPOSED TO ACCEPTING THE OPPORTUNITY BUT HIS FATHER PERSUADED HIM TO GO AND HIS NAME WAS BLUNDERINGLY REGISTERED AS U S INSTEAD OF H U HENCE HE WAS EVER AFTER KNOWN AS U S GRANT. IN EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE HE GRADUATED RANKING TWENTY FIRST IN A CLASS OF THIRTY NINE. AT THIS TIME GRANT WAS NOT TAKEN WITH WAR AND PROBABLY EVINCED LITTLE INTEREST IN ARMY TACTICS. THE MEXICAN WAR CAME ON AND GRANT HERE DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF RISING TO THE RANK OF CAPTAIN. AFTER THE WAR HE WAS STATIONED AT DETROIT AND SACKETTS HARBOR BUT THIS KIND OF INACTIVITY WAS ILL SUITED TO THE RESTLESS NATURE OF GRANT HE THEREFORE RESIGNED. HAVING MARRIED A MISS DENT OF SAINT LOUIS HE ACCORDINGLY MOVED ONTO A FARM NEAR THAT CITY. WHEN THE NEWS OF THE FALL OF FORT SUMTER REACHED GALENA HE IMMEDIATELY RAISED A COMPANY AND MARCHED TO SPRINGFIELD WHERE THEY TENDERED THEIR SERVICES TO THE GOVERNOR. GRANT ACTED AS MUSTERING OFFICER UNTIL BEING COMMISSIONED COLONEL OF THE TWENTY FIRST ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS HE TOOK THE FIELD. HIS FIRST GREAT VICTORY WAS THE CAPTURE OF FORT DONELSON WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND PRISONERS. I PROPOSE TO MOVE UPON YOUR WORKS AT ONCE. THE FALL OF FORT DONELSON AND THE CAPTURE OF ITS GARRISON BEING THE FIRST SUBSTANTIAL VICTORY THAT HAD CROWNED THE UNION CAUSE TOGETHER WITH THE ABOVE DESCRIBED ANSWER TO GENERAL BUCKNER BROUGHT THE NAME OF GENERAL GRANT PROMINENTLY BEFORE THE COUNTRY. PITTSBURGH LANDING FOLLOWED AND THEN GRANT DETERMINED TO TAKE VICKSBURG. ALL HIS GENERALS DECLARED THE PLAN HE PROPOSED UNMILITARY AND IMPOSSIBLE BUT AFTER SEVERAL UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS THE GIBRALTAR OF THE MISSISSIPPI WAS CAPTURED AND THIS TIME TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PRISONERS TAKEN. NOW CAME THE BATTLE OF CHATTANOOGA. GENERAL HALLECK IN SPEAKING OF THIS BATTLE SAID. CONSIDERING THE STRENGTH OF THE REBEL POSITION AND THE DIFFICULTY OF STORMING HIS INTRENCHMENTS THE BATTLE OF CHATTANOOGA MUST BE CONSIDERED THE MOST REMARKABLE IN HISTORY INDEED IT IS SO. AFTER GRANT HAD TURNED THE CONFEDERATE RIGHT FLANK SHERMAN WAS INTERCEPTED BETWEEN LONGSTREET AND BRAGG THUS CUTTING LONGSTREET ENTIRELY OUT AND PREVENTING ANOTHER JUNCTION BEING POSSIBLE. RESOLUTIONS OF THANKS WERE PASSED IN OHIO AND NEW YORK AND CONGRESS CREATED GRANT A LIEUTENANT GENERAL A COMMISSION WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BY NO ONE SINCE GENERAL SCOTT RESIGNED. INDEED IF EVER A GENERAL DESERVED HONOR GRANT HAD WON IT HE HAD OPENED THE MISSISSIPPI TO NAVIGATION AND HAD CAPTURED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS AND ARMS. HE WAS NOW COMMANDER OF ALL THE FEDERAL FORCES. ONE UNDER SHERMAN AGAINST ATLANTA COMMANDED BY THE SKILLFUL REBEL GENERAL JOHNSON THE OTHER UNDER MEADE DIRECTED AGAINST LEE AND THE CONFEDERATE CAPITOL
