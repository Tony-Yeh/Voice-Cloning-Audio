SHERMAN ADVANCED UPON ATLANTA AND THE SUCCESS OF HIS FAMOUS MARCH TO THE SEA IS WELL KNOWN. THE CAPTURE OF LEE WAS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING. GRANT PERCEIVED THAT HIS ONLY HOPE LIE IN LITERALLY STARVING THE CONFEDERATE ARMY OUT BY CUTTING OFF ALL RESOURCES AS FAR AS PRACTICABLE. TIME WORE AWAY AND ON THE NINTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE GRANT CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY UNDER LEE THUS VIRTUALLY ENDING THE WAR. ON JULY TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX HE WAS MADE GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY THE RANK HAVING BEEN CREATED FOR HIM HE WAS THE FIRST TO HOLD IT. WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SON JESSE AND A FEW FRIENDS. THEY VISITED NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AND PART OF THOSE OF AFRICA AND ASIA. HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF HARD STUDY AND ABILITY TO PERFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTIVE LABOR WITHOUT FATIGUE. THE SCENES OF HIS LATER DAYS WERE CLOUDED WITH THE INTRIGUES OF A STOCK GAMBLER BUT THE STAIN THAT THE GRANT WARD FAILURE SEEMED LIKELY TO THROW ON THE SPOTLESS REPUTATION OF GENERAL GRANT WAS WIPED AWAY WHEN THE FACTS WERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT AND A NEW LUSTRE WAS ADDED TO HIS FAME BY THE SELF SACRIFICE SHOWN IN THE FINAL SETTLEMENT. GENERAL GRANT PROVED TO BE A WRITER OF NO LOW ORDER AND HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS A VERY READABLE BOOK
