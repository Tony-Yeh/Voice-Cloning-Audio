IN THE PRESENT UNSETTLED THOUGH HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FERDINAND WOULD NOT GO HOME. HE WAS RESOLVED TO AVOID ANY EXPLANATIONS UNTIL HE HEARD FROM LORD MONTFORT. HE SHRANK FROM SEEING GLASTONBURY OR HIS COUSIN. AS FOR HENRIETTA IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE NEVER COULD HAVE HEART TO MEET HER AGAIN UNLESS THEY WERE ALONE. COUNT MIRABEL WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO WHOM HE COULD ABANDON HIS SOUL AND COUNT MIRABEL WAS STILL IN HIS FIRST SLEEP. SO FERDINAND ENTERED KENSINGTON GARDENS AND WALKED IN THOSE RICH GLADES AND STATELY AVENUES. ON EVERY SIDE THE MOST CHARMING RETREATS OPEN TO THEM NOR IS THERE A METROPOLIS IN THE WORLD SURROUNDED BY SO MANY RURAL VILLAGES PICTURESQUE PARKS AND ELEGANT CASINOS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CONSTANTINOPLE THERE IS NO CITY IN THE WORLD THAT CAN FOR A MOMENT ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH IT. FOR HIMSELF THOUGH IN HIS TIME SOMETHING OF A RAMBLER HE IS NOT ASHAMED IN THIS RESPECT TO CONFESS TO A LEGITIMATE COCKNEY TASTE AND FOR HIS PART HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE LIFE CAN FLOW ON MORE PLEASANTLY THAN IN SIGHT OF KENSINGTON GARDENS VIEWING THE SILVER THAMES WINDING BY THE BOWERS OF ROSEBANK OR INHALING FROM ITS TERRACES THE REFINED AIR OF GRACEFUL RICHMOND. IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM ALL THE TUMULT OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WEAR AND TEAR OF PLAY THE RECRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVAN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR TO THE CEDARS OF LEBANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF ANATOLIA. KENSINGTON GARDENS IS ALMOST THE ONLY PLACE THAT HAS REALISED HIS IDEA OF THE FORESTS OF SPENSER AND ARIOSTO. WHAT A PITY THAT INSTEAD OF A PRINCESS IN DISTRESS WE MEET ONLY A NURSERYMAID. BUT HERE IS THE FITTING AND CONVENIENT LOCALITY TO BROOD OVER OUR THOUGHTS TO PROJECT THE GREAT AND TO ACHIEVE THE HAPPY. IT IS HERE THAT WE SHOULD GET OUR SPEECHES BY HEART INVENT OUR IMPROMPTUS MUSE OVER THE CAPRICES OF OUR MISTRESSES DESTROY A CABINET AND SAVE A NATION. ABOUT THE TIME THAT FERDINAND DIRECTED HIS STEPS FROM THESE GREEN RETREATS TOWARDS BERKELEY SQUARE A SERVANT SUMMONED MISS TEMPLE TO HER FATHER. IS PAPA ALONE ENQUIRED MISS TEMPLE
