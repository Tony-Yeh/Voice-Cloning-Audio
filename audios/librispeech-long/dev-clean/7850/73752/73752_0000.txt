FERDINAND MEDITATES OVER HIS GOOD FORTUNE. IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING ALIKE SUDDEN BURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE. IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISGRACE. THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FERDINAND ARMINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUS MIRABEL WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVER COMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SOFT SUMMER MORNINGS WHICH ARE SO DELIGHTFUL IN A GREAT CITY. THE SKY WAS CLEAR THE AIR WAS BLAND THE WATER SPARKLED IN THE SUN AND THE TREES SEEMED DOUBLY GREEN AND FRESH TO ONE WHO SO RECENTLY HAD GAZED ONLY ON IRON BARS. FERDINAND FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS. HE SEATED HIMSELF ON A BENCH AND THOUGHT OF HENRIETTA TEMPLE. HE TOOK OUT HER NOTE AND READ IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT WAS INDEED HER HANDWRITING. RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO THE BRIDGE AND LEANT OVER THE BALUSTRADE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY. HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHEW THE CUD. FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORLORN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THE WORLD SEEMED SHOWERED AT HIS FEET. A BEAUTIFUL BRIDE AWAITED HIM WHOM HE HAD LOVED WITH INTENSE PASSION AND WHO HE HAD THOUGHT BUT AN HOUR AGO WAS ANOTHER'S. A NOBLE FORTUNE WHICH WOULD PERMIT HIM TO REDEEM HIS INHERITANCE AND RANK HIM AMONG THE RICHEST COMMONERS OF THE REALM WAS TO BE CONTROLLED BY ONE A FEW HOURS BACK A PRISONER FOR DESPERATE DEBTS. THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION. WHAT MAN IN THE WORLD HAD FRIENDS LIKE FERDINAND ARMINE. THE UNSWERVING DEVOTION OF GLASTONBURY THE DELICATE AFFECTION OF HIS SWEET COUSIN ALL THE MAGNANIMITY OF THE HIGH SOULED MONT FORT AND THE GENEROSITY OF THE ACCOMPLISHED MIRABEL PASSED BEFORE HIM AND WONDERFULLY AFFECTED HIM. HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA. HIS CONSTANCY TO HER WAS NOW REWARDED. AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE FUTURE MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM. FERDINAND ARMINE HAD GREAT TENDERNESS OF DISPOSITION AND SOMEWHAT OF A MEDITATIVE MIND SCHOOLED BY ADVERSITY THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT THAT HIS COMING CAREER WOULD JUSTIFY HIS FAVOURABLE DESTINY. EVERYTHING THAT HAD OCCURRED PREVIOUSLY SEEMED OF ANOTHER LIFE ALL HIS EXPERIENCE WAS CONCENTRATED IN THAT WONDERFUL DRAMA THAT HAD COMMENCED AT BATH THE LAST SCENE OF WHICH WAS NOW APPROACHING THE CHARACTERS HIS PARENTS GLASTONBURY KATHERINE HENRIETTA LORD MONTFORT COUNT MIRABEL HIMSELF AND MISTER TEMPLE AH. WHAT A NEAPOLITAN BALL WAS HIS CAREER THEN. IT WAS INDEED DANCING ON A VOLCANO. AND NOW ALL HAD ENDED SO HAPPILY. OH COULD IT INDEED BE TRUE. WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER. BUT THEN THERE WAS HENRIETTA'S LETTER. HE MIGHT BE ENCHANTED BUT THAT WAS THE TALISMAN
