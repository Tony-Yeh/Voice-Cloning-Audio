MOTHER MAGPIE'S KINDERGARTEN. DID YOU EVER NOTICE HOW DIFFERENT ARE THE NESTS WHICH THE BIRDS BUILD IN SPRINGTIME IN TREE OR BUSH OR SANDY BANK OR HIDDEN IN THE GRASS. SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BIRDIKINS. BUT OTHERS ARE CLUMSY AND CARELESSLY FASTENED TO THE BOUGH MOST UNSAFE CRADLES FOR THE FEATHERED BABY ON THE TREETOP. SOMETIMES AFTER A HEAVY WIND YOU FIND ON THE GROUND UNDER THE NEST POOR LITTLE BROKEN EGGS WHICH ROLLED OUT AND LOST THEIR CHANCE OF TURNING INTO BIRDS WITH SAFE SAFE WINGS OF THEIR OWN. NOW SUCH SAD THINGS AS THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE IN THEIR YOUTH THE LAZY FATHER AND MOTHER BIRDS DID NOT LEARN THEIR LESSON WHEN MOTHER MAGPIE HAD HER CLASS IN NEST MAKING. THE CLUMSIEST NEST OF ALL IS THAT WHICH THE WOOD PIGEON TRIES TO BUILD. INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE. AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU. IN THE EARLY SPRINGTIME OF THE WORLD WHEN BIRDS WERE FIRST MADE NONE OF THEM EXCEPT MOTHER MAGPIE KNEW HOW TO BUILD A NEST. IN THAT LOVELY GARDEN WHERE THEY LIVED THE BIRDS WENT FLUTTERING ABOUT TRYING THEIR NEW WINGS SO INTERESTED IN THIS WONDERFUL GAME OF FLYING THAT THEY FORGOT ALL ABOUT PREPARING A HOME FOR THE BABY BIRDS WHO WERE TO COME. WHEN THE TIME CAME TO LAY THEIR EGGS THE PARENTS KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO. THERE WAS NO PLACE SAFE FROM THE FOUR LEGGED CREATURES WHO CANNOT FLY AND THEY BEGAN TO TWITTER HELPLESSLY OH HOW I WISH I HAD A NICE WARM NEST FOR MY EGGS. OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME. DEAR ME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING. AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY. ALL EXCEPT MOTHER MAGPIE. ALREADY SHE HAD FOUND OUT A WAY AND WAS BUSILY BUILDING A FAMOUS NEST FOR HERSELF. SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BIRD. SHE GATHERED TURF AND STICKS AND WITH CLAY BOUND THEM FIRMLY TOGETHER IN A STOUT ELM TREE. ABOUT HER HOUSE SHE BUILT A FENCE OF THORNS TO KEEP AWAY THE BURGLAR BIRDS WHO HAD ALREADY BEGUN MISCHIEF AMONG THEIR PEACEFUL NEIGHBORS. THUS SHE HAD A SNUG AND COSY DWELLING FINISHED BEFORE THE OTHERS EVEN SUSPECTED WHAT SHE WAS DOING. SHE POPPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES. AND SHE SAW THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY. WHAT SILLY BIRDS THEY ARE SHE CROAKED HA HA. WHAT WOULD THEY NOT GIVE FOR A NEST LIKE MINE. THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TEACH US. SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPPING TWITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE. O WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY. THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS. AND THEY ALL PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD. AND WHERE EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST. WHEN THESE THINGS WERE ALL PILED UP BEFORE HER SHE TOLD EVERY BIRD TO DO JUST AS SHE DID. IT WAS LIKE A GREAT BIG KINDERGARTEN OF BIRDS PLAYING AT A NEW BUILDING GAME WITH MOTHER MAGPIE FOR THE TEACHER. SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE. AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
