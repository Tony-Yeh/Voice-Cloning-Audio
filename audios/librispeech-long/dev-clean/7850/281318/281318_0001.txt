SO AS SHE WENT ON BIT BY BIT THE SILLY THINGS PRETENDED THAT THEY HAD KNOWN ALL ABOUT IT FROM THE FIRST WHICH WAS VERY UNPLEASANT FOR THEIR TEACHER. MOTHER MAGPIE TOOK TWO STICKS IN HER BEAK AND BEGAN LIKE THIS FIRST OF ALL MY FRIENDS YOU MUST LAY TWO STICKS CROSSWISE FOR A FOUNDATION THUS AND SHE PLACED THEM CAREFULLY ON THE BRANCH BEFORE HER. I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN. MOTHER MAGPIE SNAPPED HER EYES AT HIM AND WENT ON NEXT YOU MUST LAY A FEATHER ON A BIT OF MOSS TO START THE WALLS. CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACKDAW. I KNEW THAT CAME NEXT. THAT IS WHAT I TOLD THE PARROT BUT A MOMENT SINCE. HERE WOOD PIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO. CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PIGEON. MOTHER MAGPIE HOPPED UP AND DOWN ON ONE LEG SO ANGRY SHE COULD HARDLY CROAK. COOED THE WOOD PIGEON OBSTINATELY IN HER SOFT FOOLISH LITTLE VOICE WITHOUT PAYING THE LEAST ATTENTION TO MOTHER MAGPIE'S DIRECTIONS. WE ALL KNOW THAT ANYTHING MORE CHIRPED THE CHORUS OF BIRDS TRYING TO CONCEAL HOW ANXIOUS THEY WERE TO KNOW WHAT CAME NEXT FOR THE NESTS WERE ONLY HALF FINISHED. BUT MOTHER MAGPIE WAS THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED AND REFUSED TO GO ON WITH THE LESSON WHICH HAD BEEN SO RUDELY INTERRUPTED BY HER PUPILS. YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BY YOURSELVES. MUCH LUCK MAY YOU HAVE. AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSY NEST IN THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER. BUT OH WHAT A PICKLE THE OTHER BIRDS WERE IN. THE LESSON WAS BUT HALF FINISHED AND MOST OF THEM HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA WHAT TO DO NEXT. THAT IS WHY TO THIS DAY MANY OF THE BIRDS HAVE NEVER LEARNED TO BUILD A PERFECT NEST. SOME DO BETTER THAN OTHERS BUT NONE BUILD LIKE MOTHER MAGPIE. BUT THE WOOD PIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL. FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRISS CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER
