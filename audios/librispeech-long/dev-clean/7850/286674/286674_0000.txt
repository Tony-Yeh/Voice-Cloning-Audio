THE DRAGON FLY CHILDREN AND THE SNAPPING TURTLE. THE DRAGON FLIES HAVE ALWAYS LIVED NEAR THE POND. NOT THE SAME ONES THAT ARE THERE NOW OF COURSE BUT THE GREAT GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHERS OF THESE. A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO. THE DRAGON FLIES MAY BE VERY GOOD PEOPLE AND EVEN THE SNAPPING TURTLE SAYS THAT THEY ARE STILL THEY ARE SO PECULIAR THAT MANY OF THEIR NEIGHBORS DO NOT LIKE THEM AT ALL. EVEN WHEN THEY ARE ONLY LARVAE OR BABIES THEY ARE NOT GOOD PLAYMATES FOR THEY HAVE SUCH A BAD HABIT OF PUTTING EVERYTHING INTO THEIR MOUTHS. INDEED THE STICKLEBACK FATHER ONCE TOLD THE LITTLE STICKLEBACKS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT STIR OUT OF THE NEST UNLESS THEY WOULD PROMISE TO KEEP AWAY FROM THE YOUNG DRAGON FLIES. THE STICKLEBACK MOTHERS SAID THAT IT WAS ALL THE FAULT OF THE DRAGON FLY MOTHERS. WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT EXCLAIMED ONE OF THEM WHEN DRAGON FLY EGGS ARE SO CARELESSLY LAID. JUST FLEW AROUND IN THE SUNSHINE AND VISITED WITH HER FRIENDS AND ONCE IN A WHILE FLEW LOW ENOUGH TO TOUCH THE WATER AND DROP ONE IN. IT IS DISGRACEFUL. THE MINNOW MOTHERS DID NOT THINK IT WAS SO MUCH IN THE WAY THE EGGS WERE LAID ALTHOUGH SAID ONE I ALWAYS LAY MINE CLOSE TOGETHER INSTEAD OF SCATTERING THEM OVER THE WHOLE POND. THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL. NOW MOST OF THE LARVAE WERE TURNING INTO NYMPHS WHICH ARE HALF GROWN DRAGON FLIES. THEY HAD BEEN SHORT AND PLUMP AND NOW THEY WERE LONGER AND MORE SLENDER AND THERE WERE LITTLE BUNCHES ON THEIR SHOULDERS WHERE THE WINGS WERE GROWING UNDER THEIR SKIN. THEY HAD OUTGROWN THEIR OLD SKINS A GREAT MANY TIMES AND HAD TO WRIGGLE OUT OF THEM TO BE AT ALL COMFORTABLE. WHEN A DRAGON FLY CHILD BECAME TOO BIG FOR HIS SKIN HE HOOKED THE TWO SHARP CLAWS OF EACH OF HIS SIX FEET FIRMLY INTO SOMETHING UNFASTENED HIS SKIN DOWN THE BACK AND WRIGGLED OUT LEAVING IT TO ROLL AROUND IN THE WATER UNTIL IT BECAME JUST PART OF THE MUD. LIKE MOST GROWING CHILDREN THE DRAGON FLY LARVAE AND NYMPHS HAD TO EAT A GREAT DEAL. THEIR STOMACHS WERE AS LONG AS THEIR BODIES AND THEY WERE NEVER REALLY HAPPY UNLESS THEIR STOMACHS WERE FULL. THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS. THEY HAD BREAKFAST FROM THE TIME THEY AWAKENED IN THE MORNING UNTIL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE SKY THEN THEY HAD DINNER UNTIL THE SUN WAS LOW IN THE SKY AND SUPPER FROM THAT TIME UNTIL IT GREW DARK AND THEY WENT TO SLEEP BUT NEVER A MOUTHFUL BETWEEN MEALS NO MATTER HOW HUNGRY THEY MIGHT BE THEY SAID THIS WAS THEIR ONLY RULE ABOUT EATING AND THEY WOULD KEEP IT THEY WERE ALWAYS SLOW CHILDREN. YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID. WHEN THEY HAD TO THEY HURRIED IN ANOTHER WAY BY TAKING A LONG LEAP THROUGH THE WATER. OF COURSE THEY BREATHED WATER LIKE THEIR NEIGHBORS THE FISHES AND THE TADPOLES. THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES. WHEN THEY WANTED TO HURRY THEY BREATHED THIS WATER OUT SO SUDDENLY THAT IT SENT THEM QUICKLY AHEAD. WELL YOU CAN'T SAID A NYMPH TURNING TOWARDS HIM SO SUDDENLY THAT HE LEAPED. IT WAS NOT AT ALL NICE IN HER TO SPEAK THAT WAY BUT SHE WAS NOT WELL BROUGHT UP YOU KNOW AND THAT PERHAPS IS A REASON WHY ONE SHOULD EXCUSE HER FOR TALKING SO TO HER LITTLE BROTHER. SHE WAS OFTEN IMPATIENT AND SAID SHE COULD NEVER GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT ONE OF THE LARVAE TAGGING ALONG. I TELL YOU WHAT LET'S DO SAID ANOTHER NYMPH
