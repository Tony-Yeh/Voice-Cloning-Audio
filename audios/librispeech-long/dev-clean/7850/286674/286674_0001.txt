LET'S ALL GO TOGETHER TO THE SHALLOW WATER WHERE HE SUNS HIMSELF AND LET'S ALL STAND CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND THEN WHEN HE COMES ALONG LET'S STICK OUT OUR LIPS AT HIM. BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LARVAE. WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH. OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER. THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD SCARE THE SNAPPING TURTLE DREADFULLY. THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD. THE GIANT WATER BUG BELOSTOMA WAS THE ONLY BUG WHO WAS NOT AFRAID OF THEM WHEN THEY MADE FACES. INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD. MOST OF THE TIME THE DRAGON FLY CHILD KEEPS THE JOINT BENT AND SO HOLDS HIS LIP UP TO HIS FACE LIKE A MASK. BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY. THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN SO THEY HAD TO WAIT. WHISPERED ONE LARVA TO ANOTHER. SCARED DAH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE. OH LOOK CRIED A NYMPH. THERE GO SOME GROWN UP DRAGON FLIES OVER OUR HEADS. JUST YOU WAIT UNTIL I CHANGE MY SKIN ONCE MORE AND THEN WON'T I HAVE A GOOD TIME. I'LL DRY MY WINGS AND THEN I'LL. HERE COMES THE SNAPPING TURTLE. SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT. HE CAME STRAIGHT TOWARD THE DRAGON FLY CHILDREN AND THEY WERE GLAD TO SEE THAT HE DID NOT LOOK HUNGRY. THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER. THEN THEY ALL STOOD EVEN CLOSER TOGETHER AND STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT HIM. THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT RUN AWAY WHEN THEY DID THIS. I WILL LIE DOWN IN THE SUNSHINE AND REST. HE TOOK A FEW MORE STEPS WHICH BROUGHT HIS GREAT BODY RIGHT OVER THE CROWD OF DRAGON FLY CHILDREN. I THINK I WILL DRAW IN MY HEAD SAID HE THE DRAGON FLY CHILDREN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND MY TAIL HERE TWO OF THE YOUNGEST LARVAE BEGAN TO CRY AND LIE DOWN. HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL. THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
