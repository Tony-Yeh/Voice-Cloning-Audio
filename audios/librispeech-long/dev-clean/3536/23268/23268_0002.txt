THE TEA HAD SCARCE BEEN MADE WHEN A SERVANT CAME WITH MISS MILNER'S COMPLIMENTS AND SHE DID NOT MEAN TO HAVE ANY TEA. THE PAMPHLET SHOOK IN DORRIFORTH'S HAND WHILE THIS MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED HE BELIEVED HER TO BE DRESSING FOR HER EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT AND NOW STUDIED IN WHAT MANNER HE SHOULD PREVENT OR RESENT HER DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS COMMANDS. HE COUGHED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVOURED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES READ AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILNER CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL BUT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER. DORRIFORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED. SHE DREW A CHAIR AND SAT AT THE TABLE BY THE SIDE OF HER DELIGHTED FRIEND. AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HORTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA. SHE REPLIED NO I THANK YOU MA'AM IN A VOICE SO LANGUID COMPARED WITH HER USUAL ONE THAT DORRIFORTH LIFTED UP HIS EYES FROM THE BOOK AND SEEING HER IN THE SAME DRESS THAT SHE HAD WORN ALL THE DAY TURNED THEM HASTILY AWAY FROM HER AGAIN NOT WITH A LOOK OF TRIUMPH BUT OF CONFUSION. WHATEVER HE MIGHT HAVE SUFFERED IF HE HAD SEEN HER DECORATED AND PREPARED TO BID DEFIANCE TO HIS COMMANDS YET EVEN UPON THAT TRIAL HE WOULD NOT HAVE ENDURED HALF THE PAINFUL SENSATIONS HE NOW FOR A MOMENT FELT HE FELT HIMSELF TO BLAME. HE FEARED THAT HE HAD TREATED HER WITH TOO MUCH SEVERITY HE ADMIRED HER CONDESCENSION ACCUSED HIMSELF FOR HAVING EXACTED IT HE LONGED TO ASK HER PARDON HE DID NOT KNOW HOW. WITH ALL THESE SENTIMENTS CROWDING FAST UPON HIS HEART HE STILL READ OR SEEMED TO READ AS IF HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF WHAT WAS PASSING TILL A SERVANT CAME INTO THE ROOM AND ASKED MISS MILNER AT WHAT TIME SHE SHOULD WANT THE CARRIAGE. TO WHICH SHE REPLIED I DON'T GO OUT TO NIGHT. DORRIFORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN. MISS MILNER I GIVE YOU I FEAR SOME UNKIND PROOFS OF MY REGARD. IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY. FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM. WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPREST. SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHE DESISTED. ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHEW YOUR SUBMISSION BY OBEYING ME A SECOND TIME TO DAY. KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH. MISS MILNER THE GAY THE VAIN THE DISSIPATED THE HAUGHTY MISS MILNER SUNK UNDERNEATH THIS KINDNESS AND WEPT WITH A GENTLENESS AND PATIENCE WHICH DID NOT GIVE MORE SURPRISE THAN IT GAVE JOY TO DORRIFORTH
