SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION. EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS. HE NOW UNEQUIVOCALLY OFFERED MARRIAGE AND ENTREATED THAT HE MIGHT LAY HIS PROPOSALS BEFORE MISTER DORRIFORTH BUT THIS WAS POSITIVELY FORBIDDEN. HER RELUCTANCE HE IMPUTED HOWEVER MORE TO THE KNOWN PARTIALITY OF HER GUARDIAN FOR THE ADDRESSES OF SIR EDWARD THAN TO ANY MOTIVE WHICH DEPENDED UPON HERSELF AND TO MISTER DORRIFORTH HE CONCEIVED A GREATER DISLIKE THAN EVER BELIEVING THAT THROUGH HIS INTERPOSITION IN SPITE OF HIS WARD'S ATTACHMENT HE MIGHT YET BE DEPRIVED OF HER. BUT MISS MILNER DECLARED BOTH TO HIM AND TO HER FRIEND THAT LOVE HAD AT PRESENT GAINED NO INFLUENCE OVER HER MIND. YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE. THIS SEEMING STRUGGLE WITH HER PASSION ENDEARED HER MORE THAN EVER TO MISS WOODLEY AND SHE WOULD EVEN RISK THE DISPLEASURE OF DORRIFORTH BY HER COMPLIANCE WITH EVERY NEW PURSUIT THAT MIGHT AMUSE THE TIME WHICH ELSE HER FRIEND PASSED IN HEAVINESS OF HEART. NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOUR OF HER RETURN. HE THEREFORE GRAVELY SAID TO HER ONE FORENOON AS HE MET HER ACCIDENTALLY UPON THE STAIRCASE. I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME. UNPREPARED FOR THE SUDDEN QUESTION SHE BLUSHED AND REPLIED YES. THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE WAS ENGAGED TO A BRILLIANT ASSEMBLY FOR WHICH HER MILLINER HAD BEEN CONSULTED A WHOLE WEEK. SHE HOWEVER FLATTERED HERSELF THAT WHAT SHE HAD SAID MIGHT BE EXCUSED AS A MISTAKE THE LAPSE OF MEMORY OR SOME OTHER TRIFLING FAULT WHEN HE SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH WAS EARLIER DIVULGED THAN SHE EXPECTED FOR JUST AS DINNER WAS REMOVED HER FOOTMAN DELIVERED A MESSAGE TO HER FROM HER MILLINER CONCERNING A NEW DRESS FOR THE EVENING THE PRESENT EVENING PARTICULARLY MARKED HER GUARDIAN LOOKED ASTONISHED. I THOUGHT MISS MILNER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME. I MISTOOK FOR I HAD BEFORE GIVEN MY WORD THAT I SHOULD PASS IT ABROAD INDEED CRIED HE. YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT. THE PROMISE YOU GAVE ME THEN YOU DO NOT THINK OF ANY CONSEQUENCE. YES CERTAINLY IF YOU DO I DO. AND MEAN PERHAPS TO MAKE IT OF MORE CONSEQUENCE THAN IT DESERVES BY BEING OFFENDED. WHETHER OR NOT I AM OFFENDED YOU SHALL FIND I AM AND HE LOOKED SO. SHE CAUGHT HIS PIERCING EYES HER'S WERE IMMEDIATELY CAST DOWN AND SHE TREMBLED EITHER WITH SHAME OR WITH RESENTMENT. MISSUS HORTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT ROUND THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED. NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIOUS LABOURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE. AT LAST MISS MILNER RISING WITH ALACRITY WAS PREPARING TO GO OUT OF THE ROOM WHEN DORRIFORTH RAISED HIS VOICE AND IN A TONE OF AUTHORITY SAID. MISS MILNER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR. SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A KIND OF DOUBT OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD A SURPRISE WHICH FIXED HER HAND ON THE DOOR SHE HAD HALF OPENED BUT WHICH NOW SHE SHEWED HERSELF IRRESOLUTE WHETHER TO OPEN WIDE IN DEFIANCE OR TO SHUT SUBMISSIVELY. BEFORE SHE COULD RESOLVE HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND SAID WITH A FORCE AND WARMTH SHE HAD NEVER HEARD HIM USE BEFORE
