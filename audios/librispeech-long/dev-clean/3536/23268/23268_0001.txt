I COMMAND YOU TO STAY AT HOME THIS EVENING. AND HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR. HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING. MISS WOODLEY WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING TO COMFORT HER BUT SHE HAD CAUGHT THE INFECTION AND COULD NOT UTTER A WORD. IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HER'S. MISSUS HORTON SECRETLY ENJOYED THIS SCENE THOUGH THE REAL WELL MEANING OF HER HEART AND EASE OF HER CONSCIENCE DID NOT SUFFER HER TO THINK SO. SHE HOWEVER DECLARED SHE HAD LONG PROGNOSTICATED IT WOULD COME TO THIS AND SHE ONLY THANKED HEAVEN IT WAS NO WORSE. WHAT COULD BE WORSE MADAM. CRIED MISS MILNER AM NOT I DISAPPOINTED OF THE BALL. YOU DON'T MEAN TO GO THEN SAID MISSUS HORTON I COMMEND YOUR PRUDENCE AND I DARE SAY IT IS MORE THAN YOUR GUARDIAN GIVES YOU CREDIT FOR. DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL. IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ACTED CONTRARY TO THAT MISS MILNER REPLIED MISSUS HORTON AND AFFECTED A TENDERNESS OF VOICE TO SOFTEN THE HARSHNESS OF HER WORDS. IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW. AND SHE FLUNG OUT OF THE ROOM AS IF SHE HAD RESOLVED TO DISOBEY HIM. THIS ALARMED POOR MISS WOODLEY. MY DEAR AUNT SHE CRIED TO MISSUS HORTON FOLLOW AND PREVAIL UPON MISS MILNER TO GIVE UP HER DESIGN SHE MEANS TO BE AT THE BALL IN OPPOSITION TO HER GUARDIAN'S WILL. THEN SAID MISSUS HORTON I'LL NOT BE INSTRUMENTAL IN DETERING HER IF SHE DOES IT MAY BE FOR THE BEST IT MAY GIVE MISTER DORRIFORTH A CLEARER KNOWLEDGE WHAT MEANS ARE PROPER TO CONVERT HER FROM EVIL. BUT MY DEAR MADAM SHE MUST BE PRESERVED FROM THE EVIL OF DISOBEDIENCE AND AS YOU TEMPTED YOU WILL BE THE MOST LIKELY TO DISSUADE HER. BUT IF YOU WILL NOT I MUST ENDEAVOUR. MISS WOODLEY WAS LEAVING THE ROOM TO PERFORM THIS GOOD WORK WHEN MISSUS HORTON IN IMITATION OF THE EXAMPLE GIVEN HER BY DORRIFORTH CRIED. NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THIS ROOM THIS EVENING. MISS WOODLEY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED. AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND. MISSUS HORTON BEGAN TO MAKE TEA WITH A MIND AS INTENT UPON SOMETHING ELSE AS DORRIFORTH'S SHE LONGED FOR THE EVENT OF THIS MISUNDERSTANDING AND THOUGH SHE WISHED NO ILL TO MISS MILNER YET WITH AN INCLINATION BENT UPON SEEING SOMETHING NEW WITHOUT THE FATIGUE OF GOING OUT OF HER OWN HOUSE SHE WAS NOT OVER SCRUPULOUS WHAT THAT NOVELTY MIGHT BE. BUT FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD HAVE THE IMPRUDENCE TO SPEAK A WORD UPON THE SUBJECT WHICH EMPLOYED HER THOUGHTS OR EVEN TO LOOK AS IF SHE THOUGHT OF IT AT ALL SHE PINCHED HER LIPS CLOSE TOGETHER AND CAST HER EYES ON VACANCY LEST THEIR SIGNIFICANT REGARDS MIGHT EXPOSE HER TO DETECTION. AND FOR FEAR ANY NOISE SHOULD INTERCEPT EVEN THE SOUND OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN SHE WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM MORE SOFTLY THAN USUAL AND MORE SOFTLY TOUCHED EVERY THING SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LAY HER HAND ON. MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE GINGLE OF A TEA SPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET. MISSUS HORTON TOO IN THE SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE. MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM
