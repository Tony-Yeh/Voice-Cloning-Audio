IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBOROUGH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES. MISTER BIDEAWHILE HAD FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO DECLINE TO MOVE IN THE MATTER AT ALL. WITH HUGH STANBURY TREVELYAN HAD HAD A DIRECT QUARREL. MISTER AND MISSUS OUTHOUSE HE REGARDED AS BITTER ENEMIES WHO HAD TAKEN THE PART OF HIS WIFE WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO THE DECENCIES OF LIFE. AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE. TREVELYAN REMAINED IN THE NORTH OF ITALY UP TO THE MIDDLE OF MARCH SPENDING A FORTUNE IN SENDING TELEGRAMS TO BOZZLE INSTIGATING BOZZLE BY ALL THE MEANS IN HIS POWER TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE CHILD DESIRING HIM AT ONE TIME TO POUNCE DOWN UPON THE PARSONAGE OF SAINT DIDDULPH'S WITH A BATTALION OF POLICEMEN ARMED TO THE TEETH WITH THE LAW'S AUTHORITY AND AT ANOTHER TIME SUGGESTING TO HIM TO FIND HIS WAY BY STRATAGEM INTO MISTER OUTHOUSE'S CASTLE AND CARRY OFF THE CHILD IN HIS ARMS. AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR. BOZZLE HAD IN TRUTH MADE BUT ONE PERSONAL APPLICATION FOR THE CHILD AT SAINT DIDDULPH'S. IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL. BUT HE HAD NEVER APPLIED AGAIN AT THE PARSONAGE DISREGARDING THE LETTERS THE TELEGRAMS AND EVEN THE PROMISES WHICH HAD COME TO HIM FROM HIS EMPLOYER WITH SUCH FREQUENCY. THE TRUTH WAS THAT MISSUS BOZZLE WAS OPPOSED TO THE PROPOSED SEPARATION OF THE MOTHER AND THE CHILD AND THAT BOZZLE WAS A MAN WHO LISTENED TO THE WORDS OF HIS WIFE. MISSUS BOZZLE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER. AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS. BUT NOW WHEN A DEMAND WAS MADE UPON BOZZLE TO VIOLATE THE SANCTITY OF THE CLERGYMAN'S HOUSE AND WITHDRAW THE CHILD BY FORCE OR STRATAGEM SHE BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT THE PALMY DAYS OF THE TREVELYAN AFFAIR WERE OVER FOR THEM AND THAT IT WOULD BE WISE ON HER HUSBAND'S PART GRADUALLY TO BACK OUT OF THE GENTLEMAN'S EMPLOYMENT. AND AIN'T YOU WORKED FOR THE MONEY DOWN TO HEXETER ONE TIME ACROSS THE WATER PRETTY WELL DAY AND NIGHT WATCHING THAT ERE CLERGYMAN'S OUSE LIKE A CAT WHAT MORE'D HE HAVE. AS TO THE CHILD I WON'T HEAR OF IT B THE CHILD SHAN'T COME HERE. WE'D ALL BE SHEWED UP IN THE PAPERS AS THAT BLACK THAT THEY'D HOOT US ALONG THE STREETS IT AIN'T THE REGULAR LINE OF BUSINESS BOZZLE AND THERE AIN'T NO GOOD TO BE GOT NEVER BY GOING OFF THE REGULAR LINE. WHEREUPON BOZZLE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND AGAIN READ THE LETTER. A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TREVELYAN ON TREVELYAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND. IT AIN'T TO BE DONE YOU KNOW SAID BOZZLE. OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOZZLE. IT AIN'T TO BE DONE ANYWAYS NOT IN MY WAY OF BUSINESS. WHY DIDN'T HE GO TO SKINT AS I TOLD HIM WHEN HIS OWN LAWYER WAS TOO DAINTY FOR THE JOB. THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOZZLE'S LAW. I DON'T BELIEVE IT B BUT HE HAVE I TELL YOU. HE CAN'T SUCKLE EM CAN HE. I DON'T BELIEVE A BIT OF HIS RIGHTS. WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED AGAIN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN. IT'S BEEN BEFORE THE COURT A HUNDRED TIMES. HE'LL GET THE CHILD FAST ENOUGH IF HE'LL GO BEFORE THE COURT. ANYWAYS IT AIN'T YOUR BUSINESS BOZZLE AND DON'T YOU MEDDLE NOR MAKE
