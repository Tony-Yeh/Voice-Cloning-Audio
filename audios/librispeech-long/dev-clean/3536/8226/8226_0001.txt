THE MONEY'S GOOD MONEY AS LONG AS IT'S HONEST EARNED BUT WHEN YOU COME TO RAMPAGING AND BREAKING INTO A GENT'S HOUSE THEN I SAY MONEY MAY BE HAD A DEAL TOO HARD. IN THIS SPECIAL LETTER WHICH HAD NOW COME TO HAND BOZZLE WAS NOT INSTRUCTED TO RAMPAGE. HE WAS SIMPLY DESIRED TO MAKE A FURTHER OFFICIAL REQUISITION FOR THE BOY AT THE PARSONAGE AND TO EXPLAIN TO MISTER OUTHOUSE MISSUS OUTHOUSE AND MISSUS TREVELYAN OR TO AS MANY OF THEM AS HE COULD CONTRIVE TO SEE THAT MISTER TREVELYAN WAS IMMEDIATELY ABOUT TO RETURN TO LONDON AND THAT HE WOULD PUT THE LAW INTO EXECUTION IF HIS SON WERE NOT GIVEN UP TO HIM AT ONCE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOZZLE IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOZZLE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD. IT'S LOVE FOR HER AS HAS DONE IT THEN SAID BOZZLE SHAKING HIS HEAD. I'M NOT A TAKING OF HER PART B. A WOMAN AS HAS A HUSBAND AS FINDS HER WITH HER WITTELS REGULAR AND WITH WHAT'S DECENT AND COMFORTABLE BESIDE OUGHT TO BE CONTENTED. I'VE NEVER SAID NO OTHER THAN THAT I AIN'T NO PATIENCE WITH YOUR SAUCY MADAMES AS CAN'T REMEMBER AS THEY'RE EATING AN HONEST MAN'S BREAD. DRAT EM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS. IT'S JUST HIDLENESS CAUSE THERE AIN'T A HA'PORTH FOR EM TO DO. IT'S THAT AS MAKES EM I WON'T SAY WHAT. BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD B. AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. MISSUS BOZZLE GOING INTO THE PASSAGE OPENED IT HERSELF AND SAW A STRANGE GENTLEMAN. BOZZLE WHO HAD STOOD AT THE INNER DOOR SAW THAT THE GENTLEMAN WAS MISTER TREVELYAN. THE LETTER WHICH WAS STILL IN THE EX POLICEMAN'S HAND HAD REACHED STONY WALK ON THE PREVIOUS DAY BUT THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HAD BEEN ABSENT FINDING OUT FACTS FOLLOWING UP HIS PROFESSION AND EARNING AN HONEST PENNY. TREVELYAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED. DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELYAN. THEN BOZZLE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE. THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE PRESENT EXCEPT THE BABY AND BOZZLE INTIMATED THAT LET MATTERS BE AS DELICATE AS THEY MIGHT THEY COULD BE DISCUSSED WITH PERFECT SECURITY IN HIS WIFE'S PRESENCE. BUT TREVELYAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS. BOZZLE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES. IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOZZLE TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME. TREVELYAN HAD NEVER BELIEVED HIS ALLY TO BE MORE THAN AN ORDINARY EX POLICEMAN BUT HE HAD NOT CONSIDERED HOW UNATTRACTIVE MIGHT BE THE INTERIOR OF A PRIVATE DETECTIVE'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE. MISSUS BOZZLE HAD SET A CHAIR FOR HIM BUT HE HAD DECLINED TO SIT DOWN. THE ROOM WAS DIRTY AND VERY CLOSE AS THOUGH NO BREATH OF AIR WAS EVER ALLOWED TO FIND ENTRANCE THERE. PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVELYAN. MISSUS BOZZLE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT. THE WELL BRUSHED HAT WAS FETCHED FROM A CUPBOARD AND IT WAS ASTONISHING TO SEE HOW EASILY AND HOW QUICKLY THE OUTER RESPECTABILITY OF BOZZLE WAS RESTORED. WELL SAID TREVELYAN AS SOON AS THEY WERE TOGETHER IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK. THERE HASN'T BEEN NOTHING TO BE DONE SIR SAID BOZZLE WHY NOT. TREVELYAN COULD PERCEIVE AT ONCE THAT THE AUTHORITY WHICH HE HAD ONCE RESPECTED HAD GONE FROM THE MAN. BOZZLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY. HE KNEW HIMSELF TO BE SOMEBODY AND COULD BE EASY SELF CONFIDENT CONFIDENTIAL SEVERE AUTHORITATIVE OR EVEN ARROGANT AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MOMENT MIGHT DEMAND. BUT HE HAD BEEN FOUND WITH HIS COAT OFF AND A BABY IN HIS ARMS AND HE COULD NOT RECOVER HIMSELF
